The University of Portsmouth, UK, is offering support for one PhD student
to work with Scott Armbruster investigating: “Mechanisms of major
evolutionary transitions between pollination mutualisms in *Dalechampia*
vines” (Research Project Code: BIOL2231016)



&ndash;Support is available only to UK and EU/EEA students.



Project detail: Although evolutionary shifts between ecological
relationships among organisms contribute significantly to the origin and
maintenance of biodiversity, how such transitions occur remains poorly
understood. As a result of rapid environmental change worldwide (e.g.
changing climate, widespread deforestation), important plant-animal
mutualisms are being lost or degraded. Understanding how transitions
between mutualisms have occurred in the past may help in mitigating future
biodiversity loss. Application of modern methods of molecular
phylogenetics, combined with phenotypic selection analysis, population
genetics, natural product chemistry, SEM studies of development, and
biosynthetic and developmental genetics, to species of Dalechampia vines
(Euphorbiaceae) with divergent pollination mutualisms should generate
insights of unprecedented resolution into the mechanisms of major shifts in
pollination ecology.



Further information and application instructions are available at:

  <div class="title"><a href="http://phylonetworks.blogspot.com/2016/02/through-glass-darkly.html">Through a Glass Darkly</a></div>
  <div class="description"><br />In an earlier <a href="http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2015/12/lexicostatistics-predecessor-of.html">blogpost</a>I mentioned the now largely abandoned discipline of <i>lexicostatistics</i> that was in vogue in the 1950s, originally initiated by Morris Swadesh (1909-1967; <a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Swadesh1950">Swadesh 1950</a>, <a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Swadesh1952">1952</a>, <a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Swadesh1955">1955</a>), but abandoned in the 1960s and henceforth often labeled as some kind of a <i>failed theory</i> that was explicitly proven to be wrong. <br /><br />The crucial idea of Swadesh was to investigate lexical change from the perspective of the <i>meaning</i> of words. This perspective is contrasted with the perspective which takes similar (cognate) word forms in different languages as a starting point and compares to which degree they differ in their meanings.  Swadesh's perspective, instead, starts from a set of meanings and investigates by which word forms they are expressed, and is also called an <i>onomasiological perspective</i> (which "names" are assigned to concepts?), while the other perspective is called a <i>semasiological perspective</i>(which "meanings" can words have?).<br /><br />From a semasiological perspective, we would start from a set of related words and investigate their meanings. In this way, we could compare English <i>head</i>with German <i>Hauptstadt</i> "capital city" or English <i>cup</i> with German <i>Kopf</i> "head". Through such an analysis, we would learn that there was a semantic shift from the German word <i>Haupt</i>, which originally meant "head", to a more abstract meaning that is now probably best translated as "capital" or "main", and only occurs in compounds, such as <i>Hauptstadt</i> "capital city", <i>Hauptursache</i> "main reason", etc.<br /><br />From an onomasialogical perspective, we would start from a set of  meanings and investigate which words are use in order to express  them in different languages:<br /><br />No.ItemsGermanEnglishDutchRussian1handHandhandhandruka2armArmarmarmruka3mainlyhauptsächlichmainlyhoofdzakelijkglavny4headKopf, (Haupt)headhoofd, kopgolova5cupTassecupkopstakan..................<br />When looking at specific meanings in this way, one can find interesting patterns within one and the same language whenever a language uses the same or similar words to express what are different concepts in other languages. Russian thus uses the same word for "hand" and "arm", Dutch shows the same word for "head" and "cup", and Russian, Dutsch, and German have similar forms for "mainly" and "head". These patterns can be historically interpreted by reconstructing patterns of semantic shift. In the case of English <i>cup</i>, German <i>Kopf</i>, and Dutch <i>kop</i>, for example, the original meaning of the words was "vessel" or "cup". Later on, the word changed its meaning and came to denote "head" in German. The transition is still reflected in Dutch, where the word can denote both meanings.<br /><br />We can model this situation by assuming that every word in a language has a certain <i>reference potential</i> (<a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Schwarz1996">Schwarz 1996: 175</a>; <a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Allwood2003">Allwood 2003</a>; <a href="http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=List2014d">List 2014: 21f, 36</a>). This means that every word has the potential to denote different things in the world, due to the concept it denotes primarily. In List (2014: 21), I have tried to depict this as follows:<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EMVzmfZX5wk/VsL17WiwovI/AAAAAAAAAKE/jOnN3HJS1hI/s1600/referencep.png" imageanchor="1"></a>Reference Potential of the Linguistic Sign<br />In this visualization, a word form refers to a meaning, and the meaning itself has the potential to denote various things in the world, but with different probabilities. A word that primarily means "head", for example, may likewise be used to denote the "first person", as in the "head of a group", and a word that primarily means "melon" may also be used to denote a "head", due to the similarity in form. We can investigate the reference potential of words by simply looking at different translations in dictionaries. As an example (from List 2014: 36), when looking at our three words English <i>cup</i>, Dutch <i>kop</i>, and German <i>Kopf</i>, we find the following rough arrangement with respect to the reference potential of the word (the thickness of the arrows indicating differences in denotation probability):<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gXYDhZFb8L0/VsL17RBUr9I/AAAAAAAAAKM/wDuD8c1SgOw/s1600/referencec.png" imageanchor="1"></a>Reference Potential of Words Across Languages<br />Why do I mention all of this? First, I wanted to show that lexical change, no matter which perspective we take, is a very complex phenomenon. In a simplifying model, we could think of a lexicon as a <i>bipartite network </i>consisting of nodes that represent <i>word forms</i> in a language and nodes that represent <i>meanings</i>, and weighted links between word forms and meanings denoting the<i> frequency</i> by which a word is used to denote a given meaning. In such a network representation, lexical change could be modelled as the re-arrangement of the edges between word forms and meanings. If a word form looses all its edges, this word is lost from the language, but we could also think of new words entering the language, be it that they are borrowed, or created from the language itself.  Such a model would be very simplistic, ignoring aspects like word compounding, by which new words are created from existing ones. But it would be much more realistic than the idea that lexical change is just about the gain and loss of words, as assumed in the quasi-standard model of lexical change in phylogenetic reconstruction.<br /><br />This brings us to my second point. When Swadesh introduced  lexicostatistics, and his very specific onomasiological perspective on lexical change, he  established a model of lexical change that would deliberately ignore all interesting processes underlying the phenomenon.  Since then, we have been looking through a glass darkly. This is like a crime  inspector having no other means but watching potential suspects through  the windows of their apartments, noticing changes, like the differently coloured words in state A and state B in the Figure below, but never knowing  what was really going on inside those flats (state C).<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pan3kjCmBhg/VsL17d85C_I/AAAAAAAAAKI/k2OBolxc22Y/s1600/replacement.png" imageanchor="1"></a>Trough a Glass Darkly: The lexicostatistic perspective on lexical change (A, B), and what is really going on (C).<br />Yet, when being honest with oneself, the problem of looking through a glass darkly does not pertain to the lexicostatistic perspective alone, but effectively applies to all of our research on language change. It is just the size and the number of windows that we survey, and the cleanliness of the glasses, that may make a little difference.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><ul><li>Allwood, J.

University

One or more graduate student positions are now available for study of the
roles of intragenomic conflict in human cognition and behavior.  Research
will focus on the genetics and epigenetics of human brain-expressed
genomically-imprinted genes, to ascertain their roles in mediating
variation in human psychological phenotypes.

Imprinted genes are expressed from either the copy from the mother, or
the copy from the father, in every individual. These genes are subject to
within-genome conflict between the mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s copies, which
influences brain development, psychological and psychiatric variation,
and behavior.  However, the roles of brain-expressed imprinted genes in
normal human populations are virtually unstudied.

datasets. It will include discussion on single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) calling and filtering options, an introduction to population genomics
statistics using the PopGenome R package, examining genetic structure,
Fst-based analyses such as outlier detection/genomic islands of divergence
and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS).



The majority of the course will comprise practical computer sessions,
giving participants hands-on experience in these analyses. We will perform
these on the high performance computing cluster at Sheffield and computers
will be provided. No prior experience is required, but familiarity with the
Linux environment and basic command line tools would be advantageous (the
course will include a short introduction/refresher to Linux).


There is no charge for the course, and successful applicants will be
provided with accommodation for two nights and up to £100 towards travel
costs to Sheffield.

The application closing deadline is at 5pm on Friday 26th February.

  <div class="description"><p>Postdoc opportunity for 18 months with possible extension in the research group of Dr Urban Friberg at IFM Biology, Linkoping University Sweden. Our research group has a broad general interest in the area of evolutionary biology/genetics/genomics and ongoing projects focus on the evolution of ageing and the genetics/genomics of sexual dimorphism (see <a href="http://bit.ly/215ZRcM">http://bit.ly/215ZRcM</a> for more information). 

Most sexual species exhibit distinct differences between the sexes, despite males and females sharing the same genome. How this is accomplished is not yet fully understood. We use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to learn more about this phenomenon. The successful applicant is expected to primarily work on two main projects. One aims to molecularly characterize the genetics of a recent reversal in male and female body size, while the second aims to enhance our understanding of genetic mechanisms that generate sex differences above and beyond those shaped by the sex determining pathway. There will also be opportunity to develop one&rsquo;s own ideas related to these questions. The successful candidate is expected to work closely with other members of the lab (see also PhD position advertised at EvolDir).

We seek a bright, highly motivated and enthusiastic person able to work both as part of a team and independently, having a PhD in evolutionary biology/genetics/genomics. Documented experience in one or several of the following topics is highly beneficial: statistics, quantitative genetics, Drosophila genetics/lab work, and, in particular, analyses of DNA and RNA sequence data. The working language at the department and lab is English. A high standard of spoken and written English is required.

Applications should be written in English and include i) a cover letter with information on your background, research interests and experiences, and your motivation to work on this project (max 3 pages), ii) complete CV, and iii) the names and email addresses of 2-3 referees. Applications should be sent as one PDF to urban.friberg@liu.se. The position is open until filled, and applications will be reviewed continuously, but for full consideration please apply by March 1. The preliminary starting date is June 1 2016, but is flexible.

  <div class="description"><p>PhD-position available on the evolutionary genetics of ageing at Linkoping University, Sweden.

Ageing, the gradual deterioration of bodily functions that results in reduced reproductive capacity and increased probability of death, is something virtually all organisms experience. Already many decades ago evolutionary theory provided a robust general explanation for this phenomenon, yet most aspects of ageing are still far from understood today and many exciting discoveries lie ahead. The aim of the current project is to improve our understanding of the type of mutations that contribute to ageing, how genetic quality influences ageing and how this relates to the commonly observed sex differences in lifespan. 

The project entails work on experimentally evolved populations (already established one year ago), assays of genetic variation in life history traits and, most likely, transcriptome analyses. All work will be conducted using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The successful candidate is expected to work closely with other members of the lab, whose work largely revolves around similar questions while taking a wider view of the genetics of sex differences in general (see postdoc position advertised at EvolDir).

We seek a bright, highly motivated, and enthusiastic person who is able to work both as part of a team and independently. The ideal candidate has a Master&rsquo;s degree in evolutionary biology or genetics, with a good background in bioinformatics and a documented interest in statistics. Experience in laboratory work with Drosophila, or another lab model insect, is beneficial. The working language at the department and lab is English. A high standard of spoken and written English is required. The successful candidate will join a research group led by Urban Friberg (see <a href="http://bit.ly/215ZRcM">http://bit.ly/215ZRcM</a>) and will receive her/his postgraduate training within IFM Biology at Linkping University. This position is financed for four full years, and may involve teaching to up 20% (which will then prolong the position accordingly). For a very promising candidate, who does not fully meet the above criteria, a short term position may be offered aimed to help acquire the r
 equired experience needed to start the PhD position.

Applications should be written in English and include i) a cover letter with information on your background, research interests and experiences, and your motivation to work on this project (max 3 pages), ii) complete CV, iii) a description of undergraduate training and a copy of your transcripts, iv) the names and email addresses of 2-3 referees. Applications should be sent as one PDF to urban.friberg@liu.se. The position is open until filled, and applications will be reviewed continuously, but for full consideration please apply by March 1. The preliminary starting date is May 1 2016, but is flexible.

  <div class="description"><p>*POSTDOCTORAL POSITION in Paris, France: *

*Adaptation of the gut microbiota to changes in lifestyle*


A 2-year postdoctoral position in evolutionary genetics is available in
Paris to study the biodiversity of the gut microbiota in human populations
with contrasted lifestyles. The position is funded by the ANR (French
National Research Agency) and will be supervised by Laure Sgurel (UMR 7206
Ecoanthropology and ethnobiology, head: Evelyne Heyer). Starting date is
around January 2017.


Humans are not only able to adapt to the environment through changes in
their own genes, but also through changes in the diversity and composition
of the micro-organisms living in and on them. Notably, the gut microbiota
represents an important target for natural selection to act on, as well as
a significant factor to consider for human health. The aim of this project
is to describe the biodiversity of the gut microbiota in populations with
contrasted subsistence modes (hunter-gatherers, farmers, herders),
investigate the factors responsible for the loss of microbial diversity in
industrialized populations and explore co-evolutionary processes between
the microbiome and the host genetic variation.


The candidate will be in charge of the analysis of metagenomic data
collected in the lab in Central Africa, and its interpretation in light of
dietary, medical and environmental data. He/She will also analyze jointly
human and microbial genomic data. Applicants for the position must have a
background in evolutionary or computational biology. Ideally, the candidate
will have prior experience with handling large-scale data and with the use
of bioinformatics and statistical tools.


*Contact: *To apply, please send your CV, including the contact details of
two references, and a letter describing your research interests and skills
to Laure Sgurel (lsegurel@mnhn.fr)*.*

  <div class="description"><p>&ndash;001a11443146b81957052b75a5ac
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo;

A postdoctoral position studying the evolutionary genomics of abiotic
stress resistance in sunflower and related, stress-adapted species is
available in the Burke lab at the University of Georgia.

This position is part of a collaborative project that seeks to understand
the genomic and physiological basis of adaptation to drought, salt, and low
nutrient stress in a fascinating study system. The ideal candidate will
have a strong background in population and/or quantitative genetics with
experience handling and analyzing large, genome-scale datasets.

Funds are currently available to support this position over multiple years.
The position is available immediately, but the start date is somewhat
flexible. Applications will be reviewed as they are received, continuing
until the position is filled.

To apply, please send your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and
the names and contact information for three references to: jmburke@uga.edu

Informal inquiries are also encouraged. Additional project details are
available upon request.
