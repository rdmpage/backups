  <div class="description">Graduate Student Opportunity in a New Lab at the University of South
Dakota

I will be starting a lab group in the Department of Biology at the
University of South Fall, 2016.  I am looking for graduate students (MS
or PhD) interested in molecular ecology.  Specifically, in
collaboration with Andrew Russell at the University of Exeter, we have
collected 10+ years of genetic data in the cooperatively breeding
species, the chestnut-crowned babbler. I am looking to recruit one or
two students interested in bioinformatics to work with me and Dr.
Erliang Zeng answering questions about heritability of traits (e.g.
helping), population structuring, and the like (this is relatively open
depending on the interests of the student(s)).  Although considerable
data is already available for use, some opportunity may exist to gain
lab experience if desired.

Some statistical background would be useful and attention to detail is
a requirement.

If interested, please contact Andrea Liebl (a.l.liebl@exeter.ac.uk).

Post-doc position in genomics/ecology/evolution of food microbiomes in
the Wolfe
Lab @ Tufts University (Boston Area, USA).
<a href="http://bit.ly/1OzW4vi">http://bit.ly/1OzW4vi</a>

The Wolfe lab in the Department of Biology at Tufts University (
<a href="http://bit.ly/1Uo6TrL">http://bit.ly/1Uo6TrL</a>) is seeking a post-doc to join the lab in
June 2016 (start date flexible). Our lab studies the ecology and evolution
of microbial communities, using tractable microbial communities isolated
from food (cheese, kimchi, fermented tea) as model systems. Our work spans
taxonomic boundaries (we study both prokaryotes and eukaryotes) and
integrates a wide variety of techniques including experimental evolution,
metagenomics, comparative genomics/transcriptomics, genome engineering, and
in situ community reconstructions. Our research questions are strongly
anchored in basic biology, but our work will help address emerging issues
in human health and food quality/safety.

The ideal candidate will be a creative, independent, and integrative
scholar with interests in discovering the ecological and evolutionary
processes that generate microbiome diversity. Ideal candidates will have
the following:

   -

   a PhD in molecular biology, microbiology, systems biology, or genetics


   -

   extensive experience in the molecular genetics of bacteria or fungi
   -

   experience with generating and analyzing next-generation sequencing
   datasets
   -

   the ability to develop and implement bioinformatics tools
   -

   excellent time management, oral communication, and writing skills
   -

   a track record of supporting an engaging, thoughtful, and collaborative
   lab environment


This position also provides ample opportunities for the post-doc to develop
teaching/outreach skills. Our accessible and engaging model systems provide
powerful tools to promote microbial literacy in the college classroom as
well as in our local communities (<a href="http://bit.ly/1OzW5Q1">http://bit.ly/1OzW5Q1</a>).
Members of the lab communicate their science through social media, writing
for online publications, and by developing novel public outreach
experiences.

Current research in the lab is aimed at linking ecological and evolutionary
patterns of microbial diversity with the molecular mechanisms that generate
these patterns. What are the mechanisms that govern species distributions
or community-level traits? How do these mechanisms evolve within a
community and what are the consequences of trait evolution within microbial
communities? How can we manipulate these mechanisms to control microbiome
composition and function? We are also working on applied projects as part
of the Tufts University Science and Sensory Center (
<a href="http://bit.ly/1Uo6WDS">http://bit.ly/1Uo6WDS</a>) that
aim to link microbiome composition with the chemical and sensory properties
of microbial foods

The Wolfe lab is based in a newly renovated lab space associated with the
Tufts University Medford Campus. In addition to diverse research being
conducted in the Department of Biology that spans the entire breadth of
biology (<a href="http://bit.ly/1600Zpa">http://bit.ly/1600Zpa</a>), the Sackler School of Graduate
Biomedical Sciences at the Tufts Medical School has an outstanding group of
microbiologists (<a href="http://bit.ly/WDvgqA">http://bit.ly/WDvgqA</a>). There are also numerous potential
collaborators and resources at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition and
the Cummings School of Vet Medicine. The academic community in the Greater
Boston Area has an unprecedented collective wealth of resources in
microbiology, ecology, and evolution.

To apply, email Dr. Benjamin Wolfe (benjamin.wolfe@tufts.edu) with: 1) a
short description of why you are interested in and qualified for the
position, 2) a CV listing peer-reviewed publications, skills, and research
experiences, and 3) the names and contact information for three references.
Applications will be considered as they are received. For full
consideration, apply on or before April 15th, 2016.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR-BOTANIST



The Department of Biological Sciences at the State University of New York
at Oswego invites applications for a full-time tenure track botanist at the
Assistant Professor level with preference given to candidates specializing
in plant structure or development and in advanced microscopy.


We hope to identify candidates who can use our microscopy resources on
campus (confocal and SEM) to investigate aspects of plant structure,

&ldquo;A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a
public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around
the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast
collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture a little
old lady at the back of the room got up and said: &lsquo;What you have told
us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of
a giant tortoise.&rsquo; The scientist gave a superior smile before replying,
'What is the turtle standing on?&rsquo; 'You&rsquo;re very clever, young man, very

  <div class="description"><p>Workshop: Sex roles and adult sex ratios

15-17 April, 2016, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary

Sexual selection, mating systems, parental care and sex roles attract
considerable interest in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and
beyond. One of core ideas is that the environment imposes specific
pressures that select for particular breeding system, mating behaviour and
patterns of parental care. Recent works are shifting the emphasis from the
abiotic environment to the social environment, of which an important
indicator is the adult sex ratio (ASR). ASR varies widely in nature, and
understanding the causes and consequences of this variation is an important
goal because ASR impacts behaviour and reproduction, and ultimately
population fitness. The causes and implications of ASR variation in wild
populations, however, remain obscure. The objectives of this workshop are
to overview recent studies in sex roles and sex ratios, and to evaluate the
use of phylogenetic comparative methods for the analyses of sex roles and
sex ratios. This workshop will be relevant to postgraduate students, young
scientists and established scholars with an interest in evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology and population demography.

Confirmed invited speakers will include
Professor Robert Freckleton, University of Sheffield, UK
Professor Jan Komdeur, University of Groningen, The Netherlands
Dr Vladimir Remes, Palacky University, Czech Republic
Professor Zoltn Varga, University of Debrecen, Hungary

2016 September 5, 9am - September 7, 5pm
Universit?? Paris Diderot - Paris 7, France

&ldquo;To collect and codify the fact of variation is the first duty of the
naturalist [???] ; we need a compact catalogue of the known facts, a list
which shall contain as far as possible all cases of variation observed
&rdquo; - William Bateson (1894)

Gephebase is an online database scheduled for public release in Fall
2016 that will integrate our current knowledge of genotype-phenotype
relationships in a time of accelerated discovery (GWAS, QTL mapping,
reverse genetics). The first version will include no less than 1500
entries, forming an extensive catalogue of the empirical studies that
have associated genetic changes to specific phenotypic variations in
Eukaryotes.

We are inviting 20 researchers working on different aspects of genetic
evolution to join us in Paris next September, and kick-start a community
effort on the meta-analysis of the so-called Loci of Evolution. The
first day will consist in a presentation of Gephebase contents, and
its general potential for meta-analysis. On the second and third day,
we will have small discussion groups with the overarching goal of
cross-pollinating opinions and initiate the writing of collaborative
reviews. Participants are encouraged to come to the Workshop with a
research question in mind. Here are a few possibilities:

-	Trait-centered themes: Domestication; Reproductive Isolation;
Innate Immunity, Morphological Patterns ; Xenobiotic Resistance; Behavior;
Adaptation to Extreme Environments???

-	Concept-centered themes: Micro- vs. Macro-evolution;
Convergence: mutations in the same vs. different genes; Lateral
transfers and Ancestral polymorphisms; Epistasis and complex genetic
architectures; Mutational Biases; Optimal Pleiotropy and Mutational
Target Size; Structural, regulatory and coding evolution; Balancing
selection Vs. Mutation-selection balance; Effects of population size;
Loss vs. Gain of function in evolution???

We are looking forward to meeting you and synergizing our efforts to
synthetize genetic knowledge. This is an exciting time for evolutionary
genetics!

No registration fee, meals and refreshments offered, lodging and travel
in charge of the attendants (participants who need assistance to cover
these costs are welcome to contact us). Graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers and permanent researchers are encouraged to apply before
April 15th 2016.

the Growth of Globally Important Plants (Uni. Lausanne, Switzerland)
2 PhD student positions are available in the Sanders&rsquo; group to study
the relationship between the genotype of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi
and the growth of cassava. Cassava feeds almost one billion people
in the world. Our research in the laboratory, and in the field, shows
that genetic variation in mycorrhizal fungi is associated with large
differences in cassava growth. We will study this in more detail to
find out which aspects of genetic variation in these fungi causes high
growth rates in cassava. The two PhD student positions will involve
genomics techniques and advanced bioinformatics to understand genetic
variation in the genomes of these fungi. Secondly, this information will
be coupled with field experiments conducted in Colombia where genomic
and transcriptomic data from both the plant and the fungus will be
put together.

It is intended that the results of this project will lead to real
practical applications in the future to increase production of food in
areas of the world where starvation is a major problem.

Candidates must be highly motivated and have knowledge in at least
one of the following fields:  molecular biology; quantitative genetics;
bioinformatics The two successful candidates will not do the same project
but should be complimentary to each other.

  <div class="description"><p>Postdoc/Researcherin Systematic Biology

UppsalaUniversity is an international research university focused on the
development of science and education. Our most important assets are all
the individuals who with their curiosity and their dedication make Uppsala
University one of Swedens most exciting work places. Uppsala University
has 40,000 students, 7,000 employees and a turnover of SEK 6,5 billion.

Description:Resolving the global tree of life has long been a main
goal of Biology. In recent years, breakthroughs in high-throughput
sequencing and faster phylogenetic algorithms have allowed to refine
the structure of the tree in unprecedented ways. For eukaryotes, all
major groups as well as many once enigmatic lineages now have genomic
data available. This wealth of data has opened the door to study the
deep relationships among eukaryotes with more confidence, and map onto
the tree some of the main evolutionary events. Here, we propose to
go further by combining phylogenetics, genomics (i.e. phylogenomics),
and molecular dating to address long-standing questions in eukaryote
evolution, such as the origin and spread of plastids. For this purpose,
we will infer a genomic timescale calibrated with the microfossil record
of protists, which presents the key benefit of being continuous and
thus more comprehensive than macrofossils. This is a timely project at
the forefront of microbial genomics and evolution, within a motivating
scientific environment that will lead to some exciting developments in
understanding the diversity of eukaryotes.

Qualifications:Depending on seniority, this position will be filled
either as postdoctoral fellow or researcher. Eligible for employment as
postdoctoral fellow are those who have a doctoral degree or a foreign
degree found to be equivalent with a doctoral degree, obtained within
three years before the deadline for applications. If there are special
reasons, the degree may be older than three years. Special reasons
refer to absence due to illness, parental leave, commissions of trust
within trade unions or other similar circumstances. Eligible for
employment as researcher are those with a doctoral degree older than
three years. Candidates must be fluent in English with strong writing
skills. This position is for 2 years.

Assessment:I am looking for a highly motivated individual with
strong academic proficiency within the field of (microbial) eukaryote
evolution. Proven experience in bioinformatics to handle genomic-scale
datasets, phylogenetics, and molecular dating will be highly
valued. Documented skills in phylogenomics would be an asset.

Application:The application should include a letter in which the applicant
describes oneself and the research interests (one A4 page) and contact
information for three references. The application should also include
CV and a copy of the doctoral degree. Personal circumstances (such as
parental leave) that the assessment of qualifications may be credited
to the applicant, should be indicated in the list of qualifications
and experience.

UppsalaUniversity is striving to promote gender equality through gender
balance. The majority of employees in this category are women, which is
why we would like to see men as candidates for the position.

Informationabout the position will be given by Fabien Burki:
fabien.burki@ebc.uu.se(from March 1st) or burkif@mail.ubc.ca
