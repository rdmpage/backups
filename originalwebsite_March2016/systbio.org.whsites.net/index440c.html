 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/446</link>
 <description>&lt;div style="background-color:rgb(19, 78, 162);"&gt;&lt;img src="files/amnh-logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org"&gt;American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)&lt;/a&gt; seeks highly qualified applicants for its Gerstner Postdoctoral Fellows program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.  Successful applicants must be able to work effectively in applying innovative techniques to pursue independent and collaborative bioinformatics and computational research in integrative studies of genomics or spatial bioinformatics or biodiversity informatics, alongside faculty and other researchers interested in phylogenetics, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and phenomics (the use of high-throughput computational methods to analyze morphological, physiological, and other phenotypic form and function).  Fellows also will participate in the design, development and implementation of new algorithms, bioinformatics tools and infrastructure and computational methods to facilitate genomic assemblies and analyses, as well as developing methods to catalyze ongoing synthesis of phylogenetic information and address ‘big data’ issues from a computational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Program Officer for Advances in Digitization of Biological Collections (ADBC) </title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/418</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Directorate for Biological Sciences at the National Science Foundation is advertising for a program officer position to manage the program “Advances in Digitization of Biological Collections (ADBC)”.  For information about the scope of the program, visit &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503559&amp;#038;org=EF&amp;#038;from=home"&gt;the program web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADBC program began in 2010 as a result of the community strategic plan for a National Integrated Biocollections Alliance (NIBA). The program supports some of the NIBA goals, specifically increasing access to the wealth of information contained in vouchered biological specimens and associated metadata through digitization and providing a central resource for access to the data (iDigBio).  For information about the NIBA strategic plan and implementation plan, see &lt;a href="http://www.aibs.org/public-policy/news/scientists_call_for_greater_access_to_biodiversity_resources_data.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where the links to community efforts are provided.
