  <div class="description">Postdoctoral Research Officer

Job Number:&nbsp;BU01042
School/Department:&nbsp;School of Biological Sciences
Grade:&nbsp;7
Salary Information:&nbsp;&pound;31,656 - &pound;37,768 (Grade 7) p.a.
Contract Duration:&nbsp;3 years
Responsible to:&nbsp;Dr Simon Creer

Closing Date:&nbsp;21-12-2015

Applications are invited for the above 3 year fixed-term, full-time post working in the Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Laboratory, School of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Sciences. 

We are looking for a dynamic researcher to fulfil a leading role in a new, collaborative and multidisciplinary team working at the interface between the molecular genetic analysis of aerial pollen composition, aerobiological modelling and human health. Approximately 20% of the UK population suffer from summer allergies and the primary outdoor allergens are grass pollens. Nevertheless, there is currently no easy way of discriminating different species of grass pollen using traditional morphological approaches. Molecular biodiversity identification is emerging as a high throughput and cost effective alternative to existing approaches and in particular, combinations of qPCR, metabarcoding and shotgun sequencing provide a unique analytical suite of molecular approaches to assess grass pollen mixtures both quantitatively and qualitatively. The primary objectives of the broader project will be to (a.) develop a species level, spatio-temporal grass pollen molecular genetic assessment framework throughout the UK and (b.) develop novel pollen bio aerosol models in order ultimately to (c.) identify linkages between species-specific grass pollen loadings and human health (i.e. asthma exacerbations). 

The 3 year, &pound;1.2M project is funded by the NERC Standard Grant blue sky funding stream and involves combinations of local and national fieldwork in collaboration with Aberystwyth University, The National Pollen and Aerobiological Research Unit (NPARU), University of Worcester, Exeter University and the UK Met Office. The leading Bangor component of the project will utilise molecular ecology, including high throughput qPCR and genomic approaches to assess biodiversity, bioinformatics and ecological modelling, with the PDRO working closely with a diverse team of collaborators from the fields of plant metabarcoding, aerobiology and modelling and environmental epidemiology both in the UK and overseas. The project will also benefit from close links with a range of charities providing support in the broad field of allergenic and respiratory health. 

Candidates should possess a doctoral degree in related areas such as natural sciences, ecology, botany, molecular taxonomy, evolution/genomics and should ideally have previous experience of fieldwork, molecular ecology, high throughput sequencing, bioinformatics and ecological data handling. The successful candidate will possess excellent team working and communication skills. 

The successful candidate will be expected to commence 1st March 2016, or as soon after this as possible. 

Informal enquiries should be sent to Dr S. Creer, email s.creer@bangor.ac.uk;http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/staff/si.php; @spideycreer.</div>

  <div class="title"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/job/862233_Assistant_Professor-Physical_Oceanography?source=rss">Assistant Professor - Physical Oceanography</a></div>
  <div class="description">Character of Duties:&nbsp;We are seeking an exceptional candidate to support our new initiatives in coupling physical oceanography with population dynamics of coastal ecosystems.&nbsp; The successful candidate will have proven experience in studying the physical aspects of nearshore waters in coastal environments.&nbsp; Specific interests could include physical monitoring along the ridge-to-reef continuum, development and testing of oceanographic sensor arrays, and modeling climate change (sea level rise, ocean warming, nutrification, acidification, etc.) scenarios within coastal and nearshore environments. We are particularly interested in scientists who will increase the UOGML&rsquo;s ability to address large-scale questions through analysis and interpretation of physical oceanographic data across spatial and temporal scales, from in-situ sampling to remote sensing, by performing simulations of oceanographic phenomena using computer or mathematical models.

The successful individual is expected to develop a viable and energetic externally-funded research program, make collaborative contributions to University STEM-centric research programs, and may also contribute to other local and regional projects in a supporting role. The candidate will be required to develop and teach at least one graduate level course in physical oceanography and a second graduate course of choice in a relevant field, with a total of two semester-long courses being taught every four semesters. The candidate may also be requested to develop a seminar course(s) of their own design intermittently.

Salary Level:&nbsp;Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience relevant to the position. The following salary figures are for nine (9) months:





Assistant Professor



$38,699 - $66,899 Per Academic Year





Appointment/Relocation:&nbsp;The position is a nine (9) month faculty position, three-year tenure or non-tenure (1, 2, 3 year) contractual appointment.&nbsp; The University provides relocation assistance to new employees if hired off-island on a three-year initial contract.&nbsp; Provided are travel expenses for the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s spouse (as defined by Guam Law) and children under the age of 18 by the least expensive and most direct air route from the point of hire and for moving household goods to Guam by the least expensive carrier up to 3,500 pounds for a family and 1,750 pounds for an applicant without dependents.&nbsp; Insurance of household goods, if desired, is at the employee&rsquo;s expense.

Benefits:&nbsp;Fringe benefits include a medical and dental plan, life insurance, cafeteria plan (flexible tax benefit plan), and the Government of Guam retirement plan.

&nbsp;

Police and Court Clearance: Pursuant to Public Law No. 28-24 and Executive Order 2005-34, applicants selected for a position are required to provide original police and court (Superior Court of Guam) clearances of no more than three (3) months old prior to commencement of employment.&nbsp; Off-island applicants must obtain clearances from their place of residence.&nbsp; Applicants are responsible for fees associated with obtaining the clearances.

The successful individual is expected to develop a viable and energetic externally-funded research program, make collaborative contributions to University STEM-centric research programs, and may also contribute to other local and regional projects in a supporting role. The candidate will be required to develop and teach at least one graduate level course in physical oceanography and a second graduate course of choice in a relevant field, with a total of two semester-long courses being taught every four semesters. The candidate may also be requested to develop a seminar course(s) of their own design intermittently.

Salary Level:&nbsp;Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience relevant to the position. The following salary figures are for nine (9) months:





Assistant Professor



$38,699 - $66,899 Per Academic Year





Appointment/Relocation:&nbsp;The position is a nine (9) month faculty position, three-year tenure or non-tenure (1, 2, 3 year) contractual appointment.&nbsp; The University provides relocation assistance to new employees if hired off-island on a three-year initial contract.&nbsp; Provided are travel expenses for the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s spouse (as defined by Guam Law) and children under the age of 18 by the least expensive and most direct air route from the point of hire and for moving household goods to Guam by the least expensive carrier up to 3,500 pounds for a family and 1,750 pounds for an applicant without dependents.&nbsp; Insurance of household goods, if desired, is at the employee&rsquo;s expense.

Benefits:&nbsp;Fringe benefits include a medical and dental plan, life insurance, cafeteria plan (flexible tax benefit plan), and the Government of Guam retirement plan.

&nbsp;

Police and Court Clearance: Pursuant to Public Law No. 28-24 and Executive Order 2005-34, applicants selected for a position are required to provide original police and court (Superior Court of Guam) clearances of no more than three (3) months old prior to commencement of employment.&nbsp; Off-island applicants must obtain clearances from their place of residence.&nbsp; Applicants are responsible for fees associated with obtaining the clearances.
