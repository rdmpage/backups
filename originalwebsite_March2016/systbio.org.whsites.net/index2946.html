POPULATION GENOMICS WORKSHOP

March 21st-23rd 2016
University of Sheffield, UK

This course will be held at the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility at the
University of Sheffield and introduce participants to a variety of
population genomics analyses for large next generation sequencing (NGS)
datasets. It will include discussion on single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) calling and filtering options, an introduction to population genomics
statistics using the PopGenome R package, examining genetic structure,
Fst-based analyses such as outlier detection/genomic islands of divergence
and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS).



The majority of the course will comprise practical computer sessions,
giving participants hands-on experience in these analyses. We will perform
these on the high performance computing cluster at Sheffield and computers
will be provided. No prior experience is required, but familiarity with the
Linux environment and basic command line tools would be advantageous (the
course will include a short introduction/refresher to Linux).


There is no charge for the course, and successful applicants will be
provided with accommodation for two nights and up to £100 towards travel
costs to Sheffield.

The application closing deadline is at 5pm on Friday 26th February.

  <div class="description"><p>Postdoc opportunity for 18 months with possible extension in the research group of Dr Urban Friberg at IFM Biology, Linkoping University Sweden. Our research group has a broad general interest in the area of evolutionary biology/genetics/genomics and ongoing projects focus on the evolution of ageing and the genetics/genomics of sexual dimorphism (see <a href="http://bit.ly/215ZRcM">http://bit.ly/215ZRcM</a> for more information). 

Most sexual species exhibit distinct differences between the sexes, despite males and females sharing the same genome. How this is accomplished is not yet fully understood. We use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to learn more about this phenomenon. The successful applicant is expected to primarily work on two main projects. One aims to molecularly characterize the genetics of a recent reversal in male and female body size, while the second aims to enhance our understanding of genetic mechanisms that generate sex differences above and beyond those shaped by the sex determining pathway. There will also be opportunity to develop one&rsquo;s own ideas related to these questions. The successful candidate is expected to work closely with other members of the lab (see also PhD position advertised at EvolDir).

We seek a bright, highly motivated and enthusiastic person able to work both as part of a team and independently, having a PhD in evolutionary biology/genetics/genomics. Documented experience in one or several of the following topics is highly beneficial: statistics, quantitative genetics, Drosophila genetics/lab work, and, in particular, analyses of DNA and RNA sequence data. The working language at the department and lab is English. A high standard of spoken and written English is required.

Applications should be written in English and include i) a cover letter with information on your background, research interests and experiences, and your motivation to work on this project (max 3 pages), ii) complete CV, and iii) the names and email addresses of 2-3 referees. Applications should be sent as one PDF to urban.friberg@liu.se. The position is open until filled, and applications will be reviewed continuously, but for full consideration please apply by March 1. The preliminary starting date is June 1 2016, but is flexible.

  <div class="description"><p>PhD-position available on the evolutionary genetics of ageing at Linkoping University, Sweden.

Ageing, the gradual deterioration of bodily functions that results in reduced reproductive capacity and increased probability of death, is something virtually all organisms experience. Already many decades ago evolutionary theory provided a robust general explanation for this phenomenon, yet most aspects of ageing are still far from understood today and many exciting discoveries lie ahead. The aim of the current project is to improve our understanding of the type of mutations that contribute to ageing, how genetic quality influences ageing and how this relates to the commonly observed sex differences in lifespan. 

The project entails work on experimentally evolved populations (already established one year ago), assays of genetic variation in life history traits and, most likely, transcriptome analyses. All work will be conducted using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The successful candidate is expected to work closely with other members of the lab, whose work largely revolves around similar questions while taking a wider view of the genetics of sex differences in general (see postdoc position advertised at EvolDir).

We seek a bright, highly motivated, and enthusiastic person who is able to work both as part of a team and independently. The ideal candidate has a Master&rsquo;s degree in evolutionary biology or genetics, with a good background in bioinformatics and a documented interest in statistics. Experience in laboratory work with Drosophila, or another lab model insect, is beneficial. The working language at the department and lab is English. A high standard of spoken and written English is required. The successful candidate will join a research group led by Urban Friberg (see <a href="http://bit.ly/215ZRcM">http://bit.ly/215ZRcM</a>) and will receive her/his postgraduate training within IFM Biology at Linkping University. This position is financed for four full years, and may involve teaching to up 20% (which will then prolong the position accordingly). For a very promising candidate, who does not fully meet the above criteria, a short term position may be offered aimed to help acquire the r
 equired experience needed to start the PhD position.

Applications should be written in English and include i) a cover letter with information on your background, research interests and experiences, and your motivation to work on this project (max 3 pages), ii) complete CV, iii) a description of undergraduate training and a copy of your transcripts, iv) the names and email addresses of 2-3 referees. Applications should be sent as one PDF to urban.friberg@liu.se. The position is open until filled, and applications will be reviewed continuously, but for full consideration please apply by March 1. The preliminary starting date is May 1 2016, but is flexible.

  <div class="description">Dear Colleagues

The University of Cambridge has just opened a search for the Charles
Darwin Professorship of Animal Embryology, a prestigious endowed chair.

The Chair is endowed by the Bles Fund, which states that it is for &ldquo;the
promotion and furtherance of biology as a pure science&rdquo;.  Previous holders
of the chair have done work of fundamental significance in embryology
and developmental biology.  The most recent holder of the chair was
Professor Ron Laskey.

The prime criterion for selection will be &ldquo;an outstanding research record
of international stature in some aspect of animal embryology&rdquo;.   Clearly
this could include evolutionary developmental biology. The chair may be
held in any Department or Institute of the School of Biology in Cambridge.

The advertisement has just appeared online on the Cambridge University
website <a href="http://bit.ly/1TncUp2,">http://bit.ly/1TncUp2,</a> and will shortly appear
in Nature and Science.    The link for the further particulars is

  <div class="description"><p>*POSTDOCTORAL POSITION in Paris, France: *

*Adaptation of the gut microbiota to changes in lifestyle*


A 2-year postdoctoral position in evolutionary genetics is available in
Paris to study the biodiversity of the gut microbiota in human populations
with contrasted lifestyles. The position is funded by the ANR (French
National Research Agency) and will be supervised by Laure Sgurel (UMR 7206
Ecoanthropology and ethnobiology, head: Evelyne Heyer). Starting date is
around January 2017.


Humans are not only able to adapt to the environment through changes in
their own genes, but also through changes in the diversity and composition
of the micro-organisms living in and on them. Notably, the gut microbiota
represents an important target for natural selection to act on, as well as
a significant factor to consider for human health. The aim of this project
is to describe the biodiversity of the gut microbiota in populations with
contrasted subsistence modes (hunter-gatherers, farmers, herders),
investigate the factors responsible for the loss of microbial diversity in
industrialized populations and explore co-evolutionary processes between
the microbiome and the host genetic variation.


The candidate will be in charge of the analysis of metagenomic data
collected in the lab in Central Africa, and its interpretation in light of
dietary, medical and environmental data. He/She will also analyze jointly
human and microbial genomic data. Applicants for the position must have a
background in evolutionary or computational biology. Ideally, the candidate
will have prior experience with handling large-scale data and with the use
of bioinformatics and statistical tools.


*Contact: *To apply, please send your CV, including the contact details of
two references, and a letter describing your research interests and skills
to Laure Sgurel (lsegurel@mnhn.fr)*.*

speak in the spotlight series, you will have to choose which talk slot
to use as each attendee is allowed to give only one oral presentation.

LIFE DISCOVERY CONFERENCE
The dynamic and changing worlds of biology and education are
converging in the discovery, learning and practice of science. The Life
Discovery - Doing Science Conference seeks to create connections that
inspire Biology in Action. Now in its third year, the conference
(sponsored by SSE and other scientific societies) offers more than 30
hands-on workshops and presentations, networking sessions and
two keynotes by Andrew Martin from UC Boulder and Kevin Coyle from the
National Wildlife Federation that share ideas and strategies to engage
your students in discovering life on earth.  Register by March 4th.
Colleagues from all disciplines seeking to connect educational
approaches with the rich advances of Biology are encouraged to attend.

We&rsquo;re anticipating 2000+ attendees, over 1000 talks, hundreds of
posters, and a variety of workshops and other special events!  Please
visit the EVOLUTION 2016 site for further information about the
meeting, field trips, and more.
