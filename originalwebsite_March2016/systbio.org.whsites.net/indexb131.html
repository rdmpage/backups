 <title>NSF Program Announcement: GoLife solicitation goes live</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/421</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A new NSF Division of Environmental Biology Program Solicitation titled, Genealogy of Life (GoLife), has been posted &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129"&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129&lt;/a&gt; with a deadline for proposals of &lt;b&gt;March 26, 2014&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoLife has two primary research objectives, resolving lifeâ€™s phylogenetic history and integrating the genealogy of life with additional organismal biodiversity datasets. This solicitation builds upon the former Assembling the Tree of Life program, with new emphases on a complete and universal genealogy of all lifeâ€™s lineages, broad training in phylogenetic comparative biology, and community development of open and expandable frameworks for data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Assembling, Visualizing, and Analyzing the Tree of Life  (AVAToL)</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/355</link>
 <description>&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="files/head.gif"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The US NSF has announced &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503629"&gt;Assembling, Visualizing and Analyzing the Tree of Life (AVAToL)&lt;/a&gt; with a preliminary proposal deadline of &lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;. From the NSF web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Assembling, Visualizing and Analyzing the Tree of Life (AVAToL) activity supports novel and transformative approaches to the development of an integrated and robust tree of life, as well as visualization and analysis on a dynamic tree of life. This will take place through the Ideas Lab project development and review process. The goal of this activity is to identify opportunities for investment to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in tree construction, visualization, and analysis across the tree of life. Participants selected through an open application process will engage in an intensive five-day residential workshop to generate project ideas through an innovative, real-time review process. New multidisciplinary teams will form during this workshop to engage in creative problem solving directed at outstanding problems concerning the tree of life. Multidisciplinary integrative approaches calling for communication and interaction among diverse scientists are key to the success of the approach. For example, in addition to those working in systematics and phylogenetics, AVAToL might benefit from mathematicians and computer scientists to contribute algorithms and models, bioinformaticians or genomicists to contribute data pipelines and novel molecular characters, or statisticians and artists with an interest in novel methods of visualization and interactive use of the tree of life. Therefore, members of the systematics research community, bioinformaticians, genomicists, morphologists, paleontologists, computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, educators involved in training the next generation of researchers, and representatives of any other disciplines that might contribute important ideas are all strongly encouraged to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>NSF announces Dimensions of Biodiversity Program with $US 20M budget</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/317</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The NSF has announced &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=503446&amp;#038;ods_key=nsf10548"&gt;Dimensions of Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Dimensions of Biodiversity initiative seeks to characterize biodiversity on Earth by using integrative, innovative approaches to fill rapidly the most substantial gaps in our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. This campaign will take a broad view of biodiversity, and in its initial phase will focus on the integration of genetic, taxonomic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. Successful proposals should integrate these three dimensions to understand interactions and feedbacks among them. While this focus complements several core NSF programs, it differs by requiring that multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed simultaneously, in innovative or novel ways, to understand the roles of biodiversity in critical ecological and evolutionary processes.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The program has an anticipated budget of $US 20 million, with individual projects being limited to $US 3M. More details are available on the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=503446&amp;#038;ods_key=nsf10548"&gt;program website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The NSF is calling for proposals for Innovations in Biological Imaging and Visualization (IBIV), with a deadline of &lt;strong&gt;April 12, 2010&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of IBIV is "to identify opportunities for investment to advance the state-of-the-art in biological image analysis, data visualization, archiving, and dissemination.  Participants selected through an open application process will engage in an intensive five-day residential workshop to generate project ideas through an innovative, real-time review process.  Members of the biological research community, computational theorists and engineers, mathematicians, imaging specialists from other fields, educators involved in training the next generation of researchers, and a range of other specialists (artists, illustrators, etc.) are all strongly encouraged to participate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details are available from the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503473&amp;#038;org=NSF&amp;#038;sel_org=NSF&amp;#038;from=fund"&gt;NSF web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
