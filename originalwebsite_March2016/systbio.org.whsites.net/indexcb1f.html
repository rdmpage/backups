 <title>How can SSB better serve the systematics community?</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/415</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello SSB members,&lt;br /&gt;
At the 2013 SSB council meeting, we had a lengthy discussion about how well the society and the journal are serving our members. This included topics such as increasing open access publication, better supporting empirical studies and initiating more activities beyond publishing a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to hear your opinions on these issues. Please take 10-15 minutes to complete the following survey about the role of the Systematic Biology journal and the Society of Systematic Biologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xHtdp0Ay_XL9-nLRWpxnszLuFQUyPyfUcq8Jb1m4QSU/viewform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>iEvoBio 2012 Challenge: Synthesizing phylogenies</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/382</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="files/0150.jpg" align="right" width="128" /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ievobio.org/challenge.html"&gt;iEvoBio 2012 Challenge has been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and the topic is synthesizing phylogenies. The task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, buried in large sets of trees, lies a stunning new revelation, a baffling discovery, the answer to a longstanding controversy, or simply something not obvious to the naked eye. The mission of the 2012 iEvoBio challenge is to find those revelations, discoveries and answers within your own data and/or within one of the datasets provided by the challenge.  What new scientifically interesting results can you pull from these trees, using any combination of techniques at your disposal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 <title>NEScent: Call for proposals - sabbatical scholars and collaborative working groups</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/336</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Proposals for Sabbaticals and for collaborative working groups (Working Groups and Catalysis Meetings) are now being accepted at The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent). We are looking to support innovative approaches to outstanding problems in evolutionary biology. In particular, proposals that have a clear interdisciplinary focus, or involve evolutionary concepts in non-traditional disciplines, are strongly encouraged, as are proposals that demonstrate international participation and a mix of senior and emerging researchers, including graduate students. Proposals for Working Groups and Catalysis Meetings are accepted twice a year, with deadlines on July 10 and December 1.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Society of Systematic Biologists Sponsors Webinar to Help Scientists Engage in Public Policy</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/331</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A new online presentation sponsored by SSB aims to inform biologists about proposed federal funding for science and how individual scientists can help secure increased funding for competitive, peer-reviewed grant programs.  The webinar, presented as part of the 2nd Annual Biological Sciences Congressional District Visits event, features information on the federal budget process, pending Congressional appropriations bills that would fund biological research in fiscal year 2011, and tips to help scientists prepare for meetings with lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webinar was presented by policy staff from the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) to participants of the 2nd Annual Biological Sciences Congressional District Visits event.  SSB is a sponsor of the event, which will take place throughout the month of August 2010.  This nationwide event was developed to encourage scientists to meet with their members of Congress in their home state in order to showcase the people, equipment, and facilities that are required to support and conduct scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sponsor of this event, SSB is able to offer our members access to a recording of this webinar program until August 31, 2010.  The webinar can be viewed for free at http://www.aibs.org/public-policy/congressional_visits_recording.html.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ernst Mayr and Graduate Student Award Winners 2010</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/329</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="node/10"&gt;Ernst Mayr Award&lt;/a&gt; is given to the presenter of the outstanding student talk in the field of systematics at the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biologists. The award consists of $US 1000 and a 2-year free subscription to &lt;i&gt;Systematic Biology&lt;/i&gt;. This year's competition at the Portland meetings was very stiff and we congratulate all of the participants. We split the award this year between two awardees: David Winter, Otago University, for  his talk, &lt;b&gt;Mayr√¢‚?¨‚?¢s hydra grows another head: could Rarotonga√¢‚?¨‚?¢s &lt;i&gt;Lamprocystis&lt;/i&gt; radiation have arisen by sympatric speciation?&lt;/b&gt;, and Jeremy Brown, University of California, Berkeley, for his talk, &lt;b&gt;Detecting inadequate Bayesian phylogenetic estimates&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>SB author to appear on the Colbert Report!</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/254</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Bond, of East Carolina University, will appear on the TV show "The Colbert Report" the night of Wednesday, August 6th. He promised to name a species of trapdoor spider after Stephen Colbert, which he does in his &lt;em&gt;Systematic Biology&lt;/em&gt; August '08 paper, √¢‚?¨≈?An integrative method for delimiting cohesion species: finding the population-species interface in a group of Californian trapdoor spiders with extreme genetic divergence and geographic structuring,√¢‚?¨¬ù co-authored by Amy K. Stockman, also of East Carolina University. The paper will be available from Taylor and Francis free for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond named a spider after the musician Neil Young earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi&lt;/em&gt;, which sparked the attention of Colbert.  √¢‚?¨≈?Where√¢‚?¨‚?¢s my spider?√¢‚?¨¬ù Colbert asked on his show.  √¢‚?¨≈?The world demands an eight-legged tribute to Stephen Colbert, and I do not mean another barbershop quartet.√¢‚?¨¬ù Jason Bond accepted the challenge in an earlier on-air phone interview, and will appear in person on the 6th along with several live specimens of Colbert's namesake.&lt;/p&gt;
