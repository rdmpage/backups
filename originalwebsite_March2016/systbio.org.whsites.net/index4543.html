  <div class="description">2 PhD student positions - Linking the Genomics of Symbiotic Fungi to
the Growth of Globally Important Plants (Uni. Lausanne, Switzerland)
2 PhD student positions are available in the Sanders&rsquo; group to study
the relationship between the genotype of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi
and the growth of cassava. Cassava feeds almost one billion people
in the world. Our research in the laboratory, and in the field, shows
that genetic variation in mycorrhizal fungi is associated with large
differences in cassava growth. We will study this in more detail to
find out which aspects of genetic variation in these fungi causes high
growth rates in cassava. The two PhD student positions will involve
genomics techniques and advanced bioinformatics to understand genetic
variation in the genomes of these fungi. Secondly, this information will
be coupled with field experiments conducted in Colombia where genomic
and transcriptomic data from both the plant and the fungus will be
put together.

It is intended that the results of this project will lead to real
practical applications in the future to increase production of food in
areas of the world where starvation is a major problem.

Candidates must be highly motivated and have knowledge in at least
one of the following fields:  molecular biology; quantitative genetics;
bioinformatics The two successful candidates will not do the same project
but should be complimentary to each other.

More information about our work can be found at
<a href="http://bit.ly/1Qhz1uZ">http://bit.ly/1Qhz1uZ</a> The project is a collaboration between
the University of Lausanne, Dr Marco Pagni at the Vital-IT center of
the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and Prof. Alia Rodriguez at
the National University of Colombia.

The PhD positions are each for a three year period and are funded by
the Swiss National Science Fondation. Salary follows the regulations of
the SNSF. Our PhD program requires that applicants already have a
masters degree.

  <div class="description"><p>Postdoc/Researcherin Systematic Biology

UppsalaUniversity is an international research university focused on the
development of science and education. Our most important assets are all
the individuals who with their curiosity and their dedication make Uppsala
University one of Swedens most exciting work places. Uppsala University
has 40,000 students, 7,000 employees and a turnover of SEK 6,5 billion.

Description:Resolving the global tree of life has long been a main
goal of Biology. In recent years, breakthroughs in high-throughput
sequencing and faster phylogenetic algorithms have allowed to refine
the structure of the tree in unprecedented ways. For eukaryotes, all
major groups as well as many once enigmatic lineages now have genomic
data available. This wealth of data has opened the door to study the
deep relationships among eukaryotes with more confidence, and map onto
the tree some of the main evolutionary events. Here, we propose to
go further by combining phylogenetics, genomics (i.e. phylogenomics),
and molecular dating to address long-standing questions in eukaryote
evolution, such as the origin and spread of plastids. For this purpose,
we will infer a genomic timescale calibrated with the microfossil record
of protists, which presents the key benefit of being continuous and
thus more comprehensive than macrofossils. This is a timely project at
the forefront of microbial genomics and evolution, within a motivating
scientific environment that will lead to some exciting developments in
understanding the diversity of eukaryotes.

Qualifications:Depending on seniority, this position will be filled
either as postdoctoral fellow or researcher. Eligible for employment as
postdoctoral fellow are those who have a doctoral degree or a foreign
degree found to be equivalent with a doctoral degree, obtained within
three years before the deadline for applications. If there are special
reasons, the degree may be older than three years. Special reasons
refer to absence due to illness, parental leave, commissions of trust
within trade unions or other similar circumstances. Eligible for
employment as researcher are those with a doctoral degree older than
three years. Candidates must be fluent in English with strong writing
skills. This position is for 2 years.

Assessment:I am looking for a highly motivated individual with
strong academic proficiency within the field of (microbial) eukaryote
evolution. Proven experience in bioinformatics to handle genomic-scale
datasets, phylogenetics, and molecular dating will be highly
valued. Documented skills in phylogenomics would be an asset.

Application:The application should include a letter in which the applicant
describes oneself and the research interests (one A4 page) and contact
information for three references. The application should also include
CV and a copy of the doctoral degree. Personal circumstances (such as
parental leave) that the assessment of qualifications may be credited
to the applicant, should be indicated in the list of qualifications
and experience.

UppsalaUniversity is striving to promote gender equality through gender
balance. The majority of employees in this category are women, which is
why we would like to see men as candidates for the position.

Informationabout the position will be given by Fabien Burki:
fabien.burki@ebc.uu.se(from March 1st) or burkif@mail.ubc.ca

  <div class="description">We are excited to announce that a Plant Speciation Mini-Conference will
be held on June 16-17, 2016 at the University of Texas at Austin. This
is an informal meeting with the goal of bringing together scientists
interested in the process of Plant Speciation for discussions, sharing
of ideas, and community building. The meeting will occur just prior to
the International Evolution Meeting, which begins the evening of June
17th at the Palmer Convention Center in downtown Austin. The conference
will be free of charge, but requires prior registration.

The meeting is open to students, postdocs, and faculty members who are
interested in topics related to Plant Speciation. For more information
and registration, see the conference link:
<a href="http://bit.ly/1TFdui7">http://bit.ly/1TFdui7</a>

Rationale: Our understanding of plant speciation has greatly expanded
ever since University of Texas Professor Verne Grant published his
magnum opus â€œPlant Speciationâ€� 45 years ago. From the
quantification of reproductive isolating barriers, and the order in
which they establish, to determining the genetic mechanisms underlying
those barriers, major advance have been made in how new plant species
originate. Simultaneously, the advances in molecular biology and
phylogenetic methods have allowed the study of adaptive radiations, the
identification of key innovations driving diversification, and the
discovery of unsuspected links between geography and diversity. Despite
this progress, a synthesis between the processes driving the evolution
of plant populations with those contributing to patterns of
biodiversity remains elusive. The time is ripe for a synthesis to
integrate studies of reproductive isolation in plants with those
revealing phylogenetic patterns of plant diversification.

The primary aim of the Plant Speciation Mini-Conference is to bring
together researchers that work at the cutting edge of plant speciation
at both the population and phylogenetic level. Of particular interest
will be addressing the following fundamental questions about plant
speciation: 1) Does ecology drive postzygotic isolation and if so, how?
2) How does geography interact with ecology to facilitate speciation?
3) What is the role of chromosomal rearrangements in reproductive
isolation and how do those rearrangements become established? 4) How do
abiotic and biotic factors contribute independently and interactively
to plant speciation?  5) Do hybrid incompatibilities snowball over
time? 6) How does sexual selection contribute to plant speciation? 7)
What is the role of genetic drift in plant speciation?  8) What
reproductive barriers are most important early in plant speciation and
what barriers evolve later to forever prevent hybridization between
phylogenetic lineages into the future? Can these processes determine
phylogenetic patterns of plant diversity? Answers to these and similar
questions will pave the way for a new understanding of how processes
responsible for population level divergence shape the tree of life.

  <div class="description">Dear Colleagues:

Could someone recommend me an introductory paper on the evolution of tonic
vs phasic receptors? I have been looking since yesterday early afternoon
and have not found appropriate references. If &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, please send me the
paper (or link) to blayjorge@gmail.com

Gratefully,

Jorge
