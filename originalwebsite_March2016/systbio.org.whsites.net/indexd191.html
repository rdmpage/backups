  <div class="description">Hello list!

I was hoping that some of you might have a suggestion for me. I am
fortunate enough to be teaching a one credit honors seminar this coming
semester tied to my intro level evolution, diversity, and physiology
course. During the second half of the semester we will be reading Neil
Shubin&rsquo;s Your Inner Fish to connect the physiology we are covering in
lecture to evolutionary principles.

During the first half of the semester I would like to dive a little
into evolutionary theory. I&rsquo;m looking for a &ldquo;popular&rdquo; text that is
approachable to a group of eighteen and nineteen year olds. Suggestions
are greatly appreciated and can be sent me to off list.

I thought of reading Darwin but I want to avoid the issues of
&ldquo;translating English into English&rdquo; that I can already foresee. I like
Dawkins, but given the population I want to avoid anyone feeling
patronized and turned off.

Thanks for any help.

Sean

  <div class="description"><p>PhD opportunities in Ecological Genomics

We are looking for motivated students interested in behavioral,
evolutionary, and ecological genomics to join our laboratory at Indiana
State University (ISU).  These graduate positions are part of an exciting
new interdisciplinary initiative at ISU, The Center for Genomic Advocacy
(TCGA), which is focused on the application of genomic technology to
the betterment of society.  TCGA is developing a state-of-the-art next
generation sequencing facility, which will be used to provide hands-on
experiences for students as well as strong infrastructure for modern
genomic studies.

Graduate research will be expected to combine traditional behavioral
ecology studies with next-generation sequencing technology to examine the
evolution of polymorphism in the white-throated sparrow.  Students will
conduct extensive laboratory work as well as participate in field based
data collection during the breeding season.  This species exhibits a clear
link between phenotype and genotype, making it an ideal system in which
to pinpoint the determinants of complex sexual and parental behavior.
We have amassed 27 years of detailed data on this species making it
possible to identify the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental bases
of behavior.  Morphs of the white-throated sparrow provide a unique
opportunity to study intraspecific genomic differences, which have
resulted from two separate, yet linked evolutionary trajectories -
such results can transform our understanding of the evolution of genomes.

To apply, please send a letter of intent, curriculum vitae, and the
names and email addresses of 3 references.  Applications will be accepted
until January 30, 2015.

For more information about the positions, please feel free to contact
Dr. Elaina M. Tuttle (Elaina.Tuttle@indstate.edu) or Dr. Rusty A. Gonser
(Rusty.Gonser@indstate.edu), at The Center for Genomic Advocacy (TCGA),
Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN 47809.

The Plant Computational Genomics lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut seeks motivated PhD and MS students to join the lab in the Summer/Fall of 2016. Our research focuses on the computational analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data generated by next-generation sequencing platforms from non-model forest tree species. We implement this through analysis related to gene finding, gene expression, transcriptome assembly, and conserved element identification, through machine learning and computational statistics. We use these methods to address questions related to genome biology and population genomics. In addition, we develop web-based applications that integrate BIG data across domains to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecologist’s ability to analyze, share, and visualize their data (<a href="http://bit.ly/1mudxQ8">http://bit.ly/1mudxQ8</a>). Such integration requires the implementation of semantic technologies and ontologies to connect genotype, phen
 otype, and environmental resources.

Research Topics:
Potential research topics in our group include 1) development of visualization tools to support genome-wide association studies in forest trees; 2) application of genomic and transcriptomic techniques to evaluate the impact of climate change on tree populations; 3) development of software solutions to improve assembly and characterization of non-model plant transcriptomes; 4) interrogation of natural genetic variation across populations in large, complex conifer genomes; 5) and your ideas here!

To Apply:
Financial support for M.S. and Ph.D. students is available through research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and university fellowships. To learn more about our research, please visit: <a href="http://bit.ly/1PFAut2.">http://bit.ly/1PFAut2.</a>  Excellent written and oral communication, as well as strong quantitative skills, are required. Backgrounds in genetics/genomics, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, and computer science are desired.  Interested candidates should send an email describing their research interests along with a CV, unofficial undergraduate/graduate transcripts, and GRE scores to Jill Wegrzyn (jill.wegrzyn@uconn.edu). Qualified candidates will be contacted directly for Skype interviews following review.

campus, UK

On:Trans-generational fitness consequences of chronic stress induced by
global change

Supervisors:Dr Julia Schroeder (Imperial College London) and Prof Terry
Burke (University of Sheffield)

Applicationdeadline: 10 January 2016
.

Projectdescription:
Human-inducedglobal changes impose chronic environmental stress on ever
more natural populations. The physiological symptoms of chronic stress are
changes in hormone levels that can lead to stunted growth and increased
risk of infection. Furthermore, the physiological mechanisms invoked
by stressed are similar to those in ageing individuals. Recent studies
suggest that chronic stress can lead to faster senescence (measured in
telomere shortening rates), not only in affected individuals but also in
their offspring. What are the trans-generational fitness consequences of a
chronic stress response, and how is it adaptive? Stress could &ldquo;prime&rdquo;
offspring to enable them to endure stressful conditions in the future, by
a &ldquo;life-fast die-young&rdquo; trade-off. This projects tests the hypothesis
that chronic stress primes the next generation. To test this, we make
opportunistic use of an exceptionally well suited long-term &ldquo;natural
experiment&rdquo; in wild passerines and supplement statistical analyses on
existing long-term data with focused experiments on captive birds.

Theaim of this study is to quantify the fitness consequences of chronic
stress to gain a better understanding of the long-term fitness costs
and benefits of chronic stress in a wild population the consequences for
population viability. The student will utilise a unique long-term study
of a wild passerine population. The precise direction and emphasis of the
project will be determined by collaboration between the student and the
supervisors.  Nextto the traditional academic skills, the student will
also learn and improve key skills such as state-of-the-art statistical
modelling, data management, experimental design and field work. The
student can expect to receive exceptional training in state-of-the-art
analytical methodology, as well as benefitting from a well established
and rewarding field project.

ImperialCollege London is a world leading university; it has been
Ranked 3rd in Europe and 8th in the world by the Time Higher Education
Rankings 2015-16. The student will be based at the Silwood Park campus
 which has a large
graduate student community, with internationally renowned researchers.

Dasmahaptara (University of York, <a href="http://goo.gl/RFxuOI">http://goo.gl/RFxuOI</a>). The project is on
the evolutionary genomics of great tits (Parus major) but the candidate
will have considerable flexibility to develop the specific questions.
Details of the project can be found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1OqoEE8.">http://bit.ly/1OqoEE8.</a>

We have typed approximately 2000 birds from >20 populations at a 500K SNP
chip. Approximately half of the samples come from an intensively studied
population at Wytham Woods near Oxford. The great tit genome has recently
been assembled and annotated (to a high quality), and we collaborate with
groups in Oxford (Ben Sheldon), Wageningen (Martien Groenen) and the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology (Marcel Visser).

The lab is interested in a broad set of evolutionary quantitative genetic
questions, and the project could focus on one or more of the following
topics: understanding the genetic architecture of quantitative traits;
identifying genes driving adaptive evolution; exploring the role of copy
number and structural variation in evolutionary processes; using genomics
tools to understand inbreeding and inbreeding depression; prediction of
phenotype from genomic data. The project does not involve lab or field
work, and is ideally suited to an evolutionary biologist that enjoys data
analysis or other scientist with strong quantitative skills.

The project is part of the ACCE (Adapting to the Challenges of a Changing
Environment) doctoral training program run by the Universities of
Sheffield, Liverpool and York (see
<a href="http://bit.ly/1VvPXOy">http://bit.ly/1VvPXOy</a>). Note that the
projects which are funded will be decided by open competition between the

Job Summary:
The aim of the project is to examine patterns of present day and historical gene flow among species in the tephritid fruit fly genus Blepharoneura and the same for the Bellopius parasitoid wasps that attack Blepharoneura flies. These flies and wasps are highly host-specific, incredibly diverse, and many species often overlap in their apparent niche space. A major goal is to understand why these insects are so diverse. The postdoc will develop and score double-digest RAD markers for several existing fly and wasp collections from across Central and South America, use those data to model gene flow and migration within each fly and wasp species, and collaborate with other project participants to test hypotheses regarding species interactions and the origin of reproductive isolation in these hyper-diverse insect systems.

Education required:
* PhD in evolutionary biology or closely related field

Desirable Qualifications:
* Experience developing and working with RAD-based marker system (or similar marker system) in non-model organisms
* Strong background in population genetics / genomics
* Interest in diversification, insect evolutionary ecology, insect population genomics, or related field

that are linked to ~16,000 genes associated with 320,000+ phenotypes
and 37,000 genes with in situ expression data from model organisms
(zebrafish, mouse, Xenopus human). These data present a tremendous
opportunity for integration with other data types to address questions
about the evolution of phenotype.

We are seeking an individual with expertise in developmental biology
and/or genomics, to (1) help evaluate results of bioinformatics
methods being developed by Phenoscape and (2) leverage the Phenoscape
Knowledgebase to study whole-organism phenotype and functional genomics
in non-model organisms. The purpose of the methods is to improve
prediction of the genetic basis of evolutionarily novel phenotypes by
incorporating semantic similarity, homology, and phylogenetic propagation.
Vertebrate fin and limb phenotypes and genes are enriched in the KB,
and we are thus seeking candidates who ideally have knowledge of genes
and networks involved fin/limb development.  Further, this position
presents a unique opportunity to leverage the linked developmental and
genetic data in the Phenoscape KB for large-scale analysis of patterns
of phenotypic evolution. a

The postdoc will work under the direction of Paula Mabee (University
of South Dakota) in association with Todd Vision (University of North
Carolina), as part of a distributed, multidisciplinary team that includes
evolutionary and model organism biologists, computer scientists, and
bioinformaticists.   Ideally the applicant will be based in South Dakota
(with opportunities to travel to other sites), but we will consider
qualified applicants who are available remotely and/or half-time.

Starting date: This full time postdoctoral position is available to be
filled as early as January 2016 (one year with potential to renew).

Required qualifications:


 *   Ph.D. degree with strong background in bioinformatics; previous
     experience with ontologies preferred
 *   Experience in functional genomics or developmental biology, with
     preference for candidates with a background in vertebrate fin
     and/or limb developmen
 *   Demonstrated communication and writing skills in English
 *   Demonstrated ability to work in a team setting

How to apply:
Please contact Dr. Mabee (pmabee@usd.edu) for inquiries. Applications
should be directed to Dr. Mabee and include a cover letter, CV, a
brief statement detailing your research interests and career goals,
and three letters of reference. For more information, please see

  <div class="description"><p>Potential PhD positions in in avian genomics, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum
of Natural History and Department of Biology, University of Oklahoma
Matthew J. Miller (<a href="http://mj-miller.net/">http://mj-miller.net</a>)

I anticipate adding 2V3 PhD students to my lab over the next 21
months. I am particularly interested in  recruiting 1-2 students for all
2016. Students should be willing to take a creative leadership role in one
of three principal research areas in our group: i) comparative genomics
of secondary contact in Mesoamerican lowland birds, ii) comparative
genomics of hybridization in Great Plains birds, or the iii) ecology of
emerging vector-borne diseases in Panama.

A student working on secondary contact in Mesoamerican birds should
expect to spend considerable time during the first two years of the
project leading collecting expeditions in multiple locations in Mexico and
Central America in collaboration with local and regional partners. Thus,
the ideal student will have previous Latin American ornithological
field experience collecting museum voucher specimens, as well as the
ability to understand and speak Spanish. Students from Latin America are
particularly welcome. However, all potential students with strong field,
lab, or collections ornithological skills are encouraged to contact
me. This student will ultimately perform comparative genomic analyses
using datasets that she/he developed using massively-parallel sequencing
resources at the University of Oklahoma, so NGS experience is a plus.

A student working on the hybridization in Great Plains birds should
be motivated to lead collecting expeditions in Oklahoma and adjacent
states, and should have familiarity with population genomics theory
and NGS library techniques (or be able to demonstrate an aptitude for
learning these skills). This student will combine distributional records
and genomic data from historical and contemporary museum specimens to
illuminate how hybrid zones and bird distributional dynamics in the face
of climate change.

Pending NIH and collaborator funding, opportunities to work on the
ecological dynamics of vector-borne diseases in Panama may also exist in
our lab. A student joining our group in disease ecology will be expected
to work closely with Panamanian collaborators (especially Dr. Jose Loaiza,
INDICASAT-AIP, <a href="http://bit.ly/1mQgrig">http://bit.ly/1mQgrig</a>), on
mosquito and vertebrate interactions. Specific research projects will
be guided by secured and pending funding, but typically will involve
a combination of mosquito genomics, screening bird blood for viral
presence, and modeling invertebrate and vertebrate dynamics across a
landscape land-use gradient.

My research group is based in the bird collection of
the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. SNOMNH
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1PwG5Sz">http://bit.ly/1PwG5Sz</a>)
is a world-class university natural history museum; as such, students
should be motivated to participate in collection growth and curation
as part of their research program. The museum has a modern genetic
laboratory shared with Dr. Cameron Siler (<a href="http://bit.ly/1mQgtGQ">http://bit.ly/1mQgtGQ</a>),
SNOMNH Curator of Herpetology. Genomic library preparation, sequencing,
and data analysis will be conducted in the under-construction
genomics core lab at the on-campus Stephenson Research Center
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1PwG68Q">http://bit.ly/1PwG68Q</a>). Resources in this lab will include
Illumina Mi-Seq and Hi-Seq platforms, as well as supercomputing resources
for analytics.

The SNOMNH and the University of Oklahoma have exceptional resources for
ornithology students. Additional faculty with ornithological expertise
include Eli Bridge (<a href="http://bit.ly/1mQgrij">http://bit.ly/1mQgrij</a>),
Jeff Kelly (<a href="http://bit.ly/1PwG8xC">http://bit.ly/1PwG8xC</a>), and Michael Patten
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1mQgryx">http://bit.ly/1mQgryx</a>). Additional
research opportunities are available in collaboration with the Sutton
Avian Research Center (<a href="http://bit.ly/1PwG8xE">http://bit.ly/1PwG8xE</a>). Also, the biology
department is making a strategic commitment to Geographical Ecology
(<a href="http://ge.ou.edu/">http://ge.ou.edu</a>), which would encompass our groups research
interests, and will provide world-class collaborative resources in
ecological modeling of species distributions and interactions.

Graduate students in my group receive degrees in either Biology or the
EEB program which is affiliated with the Biology department. Students
are supported by Teaching Assistantships with a base salary of 17,000
dollars and include health benefits. Students in my group are likely
to obtain additional support for both stipend and research from the
Sutton Scholarship for Avian Research, and Adams scholarships, which
are internal awards available to OU students. Details can be found here:
<a href="http://bit.ly/1mQgtGS.">http://bit.ly/1mQgtGS.</a>
urthermore, students in my group may be supported as curatorial assistants
rather than teaching assistants, depending on the availability of
funding. Students making reasonable progress towards their degree can
expect to be continuously funded. Norman OK is a great college town with
an attractive cost of living.

The formal application deadline for the graduate program was 15
December, but as a new faculty hire, I&rsquo;ve been given some flexibility
with this date. If you are interested in applying for all 2016,
please email me immediately at matthew.j.m AT villanova.edu, and
also review the application procedures in the biology department
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1PwG8xH">http://bit.ly/1PwG8xH</a>).
Additionally, I will be happy to talk with potential students at the
NAOC conference this August.
