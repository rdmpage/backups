Project title: Using biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns of Conophytum
to inform the conservation of this endemic genus of the Succulent Karoo

Project description:

The aim of this project is to understand the key drivers of the current
distribution and evolutionary divergence of one of the most diverse
plant genera of the Succulent Karoo (SK). In doing so we will be better
able to project the potential responses of the Conophytum to global
environmental change, towards the development of conservation measures
that reduce the extinction risk of these vulnerable taxa.

Lying within south-western corner of Africa, the SK biome is recognised
as one of the World&rsquo;s most important regions of floral biodiversity. Here
members of the Aizoaceae are especially well adapted to the arid desert
environment, occupying niche habitats. This is most evident in the
speciose dwarf succulent genus Conophytum, a SK specialist that shows a
remarkable degree of range-restricted endemism and 20%+ of taxa can be
considered as such [1]. The SK has also been identified as being at high
risk from the effects of climate change, with preliminary data suggesting
that dwarf succulents may be especially vulnerable [2-4]. However, neither
the underlying mechanisms that influence the distribution and associated
speciation of these succulents nor how they might respond to specific
environmental conditions is understood. We now have an opportunity to
address this by bringing together a range of complimentary techniques
using the genus Conophytum as a model.

The project will take a unique, multidisciplinary approach, combining
the expertise of the three supervisors (spatial modelling, molecular
phylogeny and evolution, biochemistry and succulent plant biology). In
addition, this study is only now possible because of the availability of
two unique resources at LJMU: (1) the student will have full access to
the most comprehensive database of ~3000 locality records covering all
taxa in the genus and (2) a genetic resource arising from a complete in
situ collection of all Conophytum taxa in the genus.

A three step approach to the work will be employed: (1) The existing
spatial database and an ensemble of Species Distribution Modelling
(SDMs) techniques (regression and machine learning models) available in
the BIOMOD2 library [5,6], run and calibrated within the R statistical
programming environment [7], will be used to quantify the role of climate
and other environmental variables on the current distribution of the 166
taxa in the Conophytum genus. Of particular interest will be a comparison
of the climatic niches of (a) 16 defined closely-related groups of taxa
of varying vulnerability to extinction within the genus [8,1] and (b)
point endemics (small vulnerable populations) versus those taxa with a
ubiquitous distribution. (Months 1-12)   (2) The Conophytum phylogeny
will be reconstructed using suitable genetic markers developed based on
Next Generation Sequencing from isolated DNA available from the in situ
collection at LJMU. This combined with the biogeographic and spatial
data will allow an assessment of the phylogeny in the context of the
climatic and environmental drivers. In addition, a methodology typically
applied to island endemic plants (see previous study by Kapralov et al.,
2013 in Hawaii [9]), will be applied to the island-like populations of
Conophytum on isolated inselbergs to understand the role of adaptation
during radiation. The Conophytum phylogeny will therefore act as the
foundation for further studies and will be used to map on it species
ecology, morphology, distribution, pigment composition, physiology,
and anatomy. This would allow us to better understand mechanisms
behind the evolution of the genus and to compare roles of adaptation
versus stochastic isolation for its prolific speciation. (Months 10-30)
(3) Future threats from climate change will be assessed using the SDMs
outlined in Step 1 incorporating a range of climate change scenarios to
project the impacts on the future distribution of the Conophytum taxa
[10-12]. Two time slices (2021 to 2050 and 2050 to 2080) will be used
with a range of Regional Climate Models (RCM) (CCSM3, HadCM3, ECHAM5)
and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (B1, A2, A1b) to provide
12 different climate change datasets to account for the RCM and SRES
uncertainty in the modelling. Gap analysis will be used to assess the
effectiveness of the current protected area network under future climates
[10]. (Months 24-36 - thesis submission)

The student will collaborate with a range of international researchers,
reinforcing research networks of the supervisory team: a word leading
biodiversity and climate change modelling research group at Universit
Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France and 3 recognised global centres of
excellence in South Africa, Stellenbosch University, the University
of Cape Town (succulent phylogeny) and the South African National
Biodiversity Institute (SANBI).

Results from this study will better inform both the National Red List and
conservation planning in South Africa via existing links with SANBI (work
currently being developed as part of an Impact Case Study for REF2020).

The student will acquire a range of state-of-the-art techniques
including spatial modelling, molecular phylogenetics, and strong
statistical/computational skills.  References:

Contact: Dr. Serita Frey, Department of Natural Resources & the
Environment, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH USA

(Questions can also be directed to Dr. Anne Pringle, University of
Wisconsin-Madison: anne.pringle@wisc.edu)

Our laboratory aims to understand connections between microbial
community structure and ecosystem function. We document the impacts of
environmental change (climate warming, nitrogen deposition,
biodiversity loss, invasive species) on the diversity, community
composition, and function of the soil microbial community, and test
whether shifts in the community subsequently influence ecosystem
functions. A recent focus is on anthropogenic drivers of microbial
evolution.

This two-year position will focus specifically on fungal evolution
within global change contexts, with an emphasis on how fungi evolve in
response to biotic invasions, soil warming, and nitrogen addition. The
candidate will have the flexibility to explore questions that fall
within this general topic area, while building on previous research
conducted in the Frey and Pringle Laboratories. The candidate is
expected to have strong interests and experience in evolution and
ecology. Expertise in cultivation-based and genomic/metagenomic
analyses is highly desirable. The candidate will be expected to work
independently, but also cooperatively with other members of the lab and
with the Pringle Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. A
Ph.D. degree in evolution, ecology, natural resources, microbiology, or
related field, along with relevant research experience is required.
Applications will be reviewed until the position is filled.

To apply please send the following items in a single PDF file to Serita
Frey (serita.frey@unh.edu): letter of interest/experience, CV, and the
names and contact information of three professional references.

I am looking for a postdoc to join my lab at the University
of Nevada, Reno (<a href="http://bit.ly/1RYnnHe;">http://bit.ly/1RYnnHe;</a>
<a href="http://on.fb.me/1ZGBjop">http://on.fb.me/1ZGBjop</a>) to work on an NSF
funded project investigating fitness consequences of individual variation
in spatial memory. The project uses RFID technology to investigate whether
individual variation in spatial learning abilities is associated with
variation in fitness in free-living food-caching mountain chickadees in
two environments (different elevations) hypothesized to be different in
spatial memory demands associated with food caching.

All fieldwork is in the rugged mountain conditions V in the beautiful
Sierra Nevada along an elevation gradient from ca. 5,000 to 8,000 feet in
the Lake Tahoe National Forest (about 40 min drive from Reno). The postdoc
will be expected to work in the field throughout the year using a 4-wheel
drive vehicle when there is no snow and a snowmobile during the winter.

The project generates large amount of data (more than 100,000 bird visits
at just one spatial array with 8 feeders, per two weeks of testing),
so experience with analyzing and manipulating large data sets using
R and potentially other programming languages (e.g. Perl) is highly
desirable. Experience working with birds and with mist-netting is also
helpful.

The initial appointment will be for 1 year, which may be renewed based
on performance up to 3 years. If interested, please email directly to me
(Vladimir Pravosudov) at vpravosu@unr.edu.

  <div class="description">Postdoctoral position: Genetics and evolution of developmental
plasticity, Ragsdale Lab, Indiana University

A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Erik
Ragsdale, Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington. Our
lab investigates the genetic regulation and evolution of developmental
plasticity, specifically a polyphenism that involves novel
morphological and ecological traits. The focal species of this research
is the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, an emerging model system for
evolutionary developmental genetics, which our lab studies using
forward and reverse genetics, transgenics, and genome-wide approaches.

P. pacificus alternatively develops into a microbe-feeding or a
predatory morph in response to different environmental cues. Recent
work has begun to characterize the genes that make up a developmental
switch for the polyphenism, providing an entry point into the genetics
of a morphological dimorphism in a tractable animal model. Moreover,
this species is embedded in a solid phylogenetic infrastructure with a
broad range of feeding morphologies and ecologies. Given the laboratory
availability of many species and populations of Pristionchus, this
system offers a unique opportunity to discover how genetic factors and
their interactions evolve to modify developmental plasticity.

The goal of the project is to determine the significance of an
increasingly understood polyphenism mechanism in evolutionary process.
Approaches will involve population genetics, evolutionary modeling,
and/or experimental evolution. For the position, we seek a collegial
and intellectually driven individual with a recent Ph.D. in
evolutionary biology or a related field. A strong background in
population genetics and/or evolutionary modeling is essential.
Molecular biology skills are a plus but relevant training will be
provided as necessary. The position will be funded for two years, with
the potential to extend for an additional year. Salary will be
commensurate with experience, and full benefits are included.

To apply, please submit (i) a letter of application, (ii) a full CV,
(iii) a statement of research interests, and (iv) contact information
for three references electronically to

Description follows below:


 position as PhD Research fellow (postition code 1017) is available at
 Department of Informatics.

The fellowship will be for a period of 3 years, with no compulsory
work or for a period of 4 years, with 25 % compulsory work (teaching
responsibilities at the department) contingent on the qualifications of
the candidate and the teaching needs of the department. Starting date
no later than 1 October 2016. No one can be appointed for more than one
fixed-term period at the same institution.

The research fellow will take part in the Centre for Computational
Inference in Evolutionary Life Sciences (CELS). CELS is a
multidisciplinary centre within life sciences comprising strong research
environments in biology and statistical and computational methods for data
analysis. CELS addresses fundamental biological questions related to the
genotype-phenotype paradigm, how the environment affects genome evolution
and development of methods for integrated analysis of genomic and other
biotic and abiotic data. A main goal is to develop interdisciplinary
research activities generating science of true interest for computer
scientists, statisticians and biologists.

Project description:

Metagenomics is the study of the genetic material in a sample containing a
mix of different microbial organisms. These samples may have be obtained
from such diverse locations as the vertebrate gut (e.g. human or fish),
from the depths of the oceans, from the soil somewhere on earth and
so forth. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled
very large amounts of such data to be obtained for analysis. Extracting
biological meaningful information from these huge datasets involve hard
computational challenges that can only be solved by good algorithms
and efficient parallelization. Interpreting the data correctly
can advance science by a better understanding of, for example, the
diversity of ecosystems or how the immune system responds to exposure
to microorganisms.

We are seeking a highly motivated candidate to develop new or improved
algorithms or

tools for metagenomics with improved functionality, accuracy or speed that
will be valuable for the scientific community. This is an opportunity to
develop open source software in areas like error detection and removal,
clustering, searching, classification, genome assembly as well as other
areas of metagenomics. We have already contributed with tools like Swarm
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1nCvufM">http://bit.ly/1nCvufM</a>) and VSEARCH. The successful
candidate will be embedded in a vibrant bioinformatics environment
connected to two Norwegian Centres of Excellence, and have access to
first-rate computational infrastructure. The position is associated with
the Centre for Computational Inference in Evolutionary Life Science (CELS)
at UiO. The CELS research environment offers extensive experience with
high-throughput sequencing and assembly of large genomes such as that
of Atlantic cod (<a href="http://bit.ly/1lBnPwt">http://bit.ly/1lBnPwt</a>). The candidate
will be supervised by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and will
collaborate with other PhD research fellows within CELS.

Requirements:

The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has a strategic ambition
of being a leading research faculty. Candidates for these fellowships
will be selected in accordance with this, and expected to be in the
upper segment of their class with respect to academic credentials.

Applicants must hold a Master&rsquo;s degree or equivalent in bioinformatics or
computer science, and need to document good software development skills.

The candidate would need to learn genomics/metagenomics during the
project, but no formal prior knowledge of biology is required.

The purpose of the fellowship is research training leading to the
successful completion of a PhD degree.

The fellowship requires admission to the PhD programme at the Faculty of
Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The application to the PhD programme
must be submitted to the department no later than two months after taking

  <div class="description">two MSc/PhD student positions available in Plant Genomics & Biodiversity
at the Plant Ecophysiology & Evolution Group, Guangxi University,
Nanning, China

The Plant Ecophysiology and Evolution Group at Guangxi University
(Nanning, China) is seeking two highly motivated and productive
International MSc or PhD students to engage in &frac34;-year projects in Plant
Genomics, Molecular Systematics, Biogeography and Plant Taxonomy. Multiple
topics are available and can be further determined upon application,
including one or a combination of the following themes:

(1) Plant Genomics - Understanding the geographic distribution and
evolution of genetic diversity between species and within populations;
understanding the role of isolation in the establishment of genetic
divergence and speciation.

(2) Plant Biogeography & Evolution - Temporal and spatial reconstruction
of patterns of plant diversification in Asia and the Indian Ocean
region in selected families and genera. Of particular interest to us
are the roles of morphological/molecular change in adaptation and plant
speciation on oceanic islands, where environments undergo substantial
change over the course of an island&rsquo;s lifespan.

(3) Plant Taxonomy - There are several exciting opportunities for
students to take part in the revision and reconstruction of a new
regional Flora. Projects will involve training in taxonomy, nomenclature
and fieldwork, but also include training in molecular systematics,
phylogenetics and the most recent developments in the field.

Students will enroll in the International Graduate Program at the
College of Forestry for 3-4-year projects, with complete waivers for
tuition- and housing-fees. Housing will be provided in the International
Student dormitories of the campus in Nanning. The first year consists
of orientation and study of the Chinese language through courses. The
following years will be filled with fieldwork, professional courses and
the research project.

Applications are now invited for an intended starting date of projects in
September 2016. The application deadline is March 31, 2016. Fellowships
come with an ample monthly allowance for the full duration of the
project. Applicants with a proven track record of successful publication
in peer-reviewed journals will have an advantage in applying.

Opportunities for the development of individual research projects
as well as collaborative work, exist within our lab and with external
groups. Candidates will be integrated in a growing and multidisciplinary
team of Chinese and foreign researchers, providing a creative and
stimulating research environment, and will work as part of a team studying
genomics, evolution and taxonomy of selected taxa in Asia and the Indian
Ocean region. Prior knowledge of Chinese is not mandatory as courses
form an integral part of the curriculum, and the working language in
our research groups is English. Projects will be supervised by Associate
Prof. Joeri S. Strijk (jsstrijk@gxu.edu.cn).

Our research team is part of the College of Forestry, under the
State Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical
Agro-bioresources, which houses a wide range of laboratories and
research groups. We are located in the heart of the large Nanning
city campus, with easy access to on-campus housing and day-to-day
facilities for life on campus. Guangxi University (>25,000 students)
in subtropical Nanning is part of the National 211 University Scheme
of China (<a href="http://bit.ly/1pqTsrD">http://bit.ly/1pqTsrD</a>) and aims to become
a major research hub in Southern China. The city forms the natural
gateway to South-East Asia, with Vietnam a mere 300kms away and direct
international connecting flights available to most major cities in Asia
from the new Nanning International Airport.

Summer 2016 REU Position: Black Hills, South Dakota.


Project Title:

Individual variation in seasonal timing of breeding in dark-eyed juncos- Katie Needham and Jessica Graham (Ph.D. Candidates, under advisement of Dr. Timothy Greives, Biological Sciences Department, North Dakota State University).


Description:

This project will focus on the driving forces behind why some individuals breed earlier or later in the season than the majority of the population. Previous research with songbirds has shown that earlier breeding individuals have higher reproductive success and optimize timing with peak food abundance. While reproductive success is higher for individuals that breed earlier, selection is not shifting towards earlier reproduction, suggesting there are costs associated with breeding early, but the underlying physiological mechanisms of individual variation require further exploration. Working with the population of Dark-eyed Juncos near Hanna, South Dakota, we hope to uncover 1) What ecological factors affect increased reproductive success? 2) How variation in parental care affects reproductive success? Possible REU projects will focus on the nesting period and include observing how bacteria (presence-absence manipulation), parental care, or other ecological factors of interest 
 that may affect reproductive success across the season.


Expectations:

REU will be expected to develop an independent project related to the ongoing research with guidance from mentors. Student will take leadership roles in all aspects of the study; they design the study, prepare a proposal, collect data and perform analysis, interpret the results, prepare a written manuscript, and complete an oral presentation at their home institution or conference. In the field we will work long hours in all weather conditions. We are looking for a motivated individual who is able to hike through steep terrain for long hours beginning early in the morning.

In order for the REU position to be considered complete, the following must be done:

     1. Write a project proposal prior to beginning the field research season.

     2. Participate in field work for duration of season.

     3. Write a project report in manuscript form that has potential to be submitted for publication.

     4. Present independent research in poster or talk format. Location and event for this requirement is open for

         discussion. There may be funding available for a national meeting, but presenting at own university is also

         acceptable.


Compensation:

A stipend, per diem, housing and travel are all provided. After completion of the REU, you can expect to be well trained in the ability to trap, handle, band, and process songbirds, as well as analyze and interpret data.


Timeline:

Deadline to apply is February 15, 2016. Skype interviews will be offered to top candidates by February 19, 2016. REU will begin project development soon after accepting position. REU is expected to join research mentors at the field site after completion of finals and remain for 10 weeks past arrival date. Completion of the REU project will depend on date of oral presentation.


Requirements:

To apply, email a cover letter that outlines professional goals and research interests that fall within the project, a resume or CV, and 1 letter of recommendation from an instructor, research mentor, or someone who can comment on how you would contribute to vigorous field research and work as an independent researcher. We are willing to train individuals, so previous work with birds is not required. Preferred applicants should have course experience in fields such as ecology, behavior, and evolution. Participants are chosen for their readiness to take on original creative field-based biological research and for their interest in, and potential for, a career based in science. Applicant must plan to be enrolled in an undergraduate program in the fall of 2016.


Application Deadline: February 15, 2016

  <div class="description">NERC Research Associate/Assistant in Phylogenetic Comparative Analyses
                of Vertebrate Invasion Success (1 Post)

      School of Biological, Biomedical and Environmental Sciences

We are looking to appoint a Research Associate suitably qualified and
experienced in the areas required or a Research Assistant that is
presently working towards completing their PhD and looking to develop
their experience in this field. The post is funded for 1 year by a NERC
New Investigator Award to Dr Isabella Capellini, entitled
&lsquo;Understanding biological invasions: a phylogenetic comparative
approach&rsquo;.

The RA will be a member of the Evolutionary Comparative Ecology Group
(http:/tinyurl.com/kswc4ac) led by Dr Isabella Capellini
(http:/tinyurl.com/icapellini). The group offers a dynamic research
environment where the successful applicant will be member of a team
using state of the art phylogenetic comparative approaches to answer an
array of fundamental questions in biology and ecology.

Using alien (non-native) vertebrates as model organisms and cutting
edge phylogenetic comparative methods, the project&rsquo;s goal is to test
which biological characteristics promote species success in space and
time, as predicted by key hypotheses in macroecology and evolution. The
proposed work for this position will extend the results of the paper we
recently published (Capellini et al 2015 Ecology Letters), by either
investigating invasion success in fish or ecological species&rsquo; traits
promoting success in terrestrial vertebrates. The RA will help
completing an extensive database of vertebrate invasion success at the
global scale and species characteristics, and is expected to work
together with the other postdoctoral researcher on the project, in
constructing, updating and maintaining the project database of
vertebrate invasions. The post holder will also contribute to the
dissemination of the results to the scientific community through
presentation at international conferences and workshops, and to the
general public through public lectures and interviews with the media
where appropriate.

 Within the School, the RA will benefit from a rich and diverse
research environment that includes the Ecology and Environment Group
and the Evolutionary Biology Group. The University of Hull also offers
a comprehensive Staff Development Programme.

Essential: PhD in biology or related discipline near completion, BSc in
Biology or related discipline, knowledge of modern phylogenetic
comparative methods, strong quantitative skills, evidence of work of
publishable quality, excellent oral and written communication skills,
demonstrable ability to work as an effective team member, and be
reliable, self-motivated and well organized.

Desirable: PhD in biology or related discipline, experience with
phylogenetic comparative methods, experience in testing hypotheses in
macroecology and phenotypic evolution across species, strong
publication record, experience with R.

The position is fixed term for 1 year. The start date of the project is
fixed to 1^st April 2016.

Salary range: £26,537 to £31,656 pa - Starting salary according to
qualification and experience.
