  <div class="description"><p>The Society of Systematic Biologists is pleased to offer Mini-ARTS
awards to enhance taxonomic knowledge
(<a href="http://bit.ly/1TU09kN">http://bit.ly/1TU09kN</a>). These awards are for
revisionary taxonomy and systematics, modeled after the NSF Dear
Colleague Letter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy and Systematics
(ARTS) recently developed within the Systematics and Biodiversity
Science Cluster (<a href="http://1.usa.gov/1dr0gQG">http://1.usa.gov/1dr0gQG</a>).
We are calling these &lsquo;Mini-ARTS&rsquo; grants. These awards are designed to
allow SSB members (students, post-docs, and faculty) to spend a summer
or semester apprenticed to an expert in a particular taxonomic group
or to enhance revisionary taxonomic and systematics research in novel
ways. Goals of this award program are to address constraints on our
knowledge of undescribed biodiversity, assist in passing on taxonomic
expertise before it is lost, increase the number of students with
broad training in organismal biology and systematics, and support
projects in biodiversity and taxonomy informatics as well as
monographic and revisionary taxonomy. Activities can include a trip to
the taxonomist&rsquo;s laboratory, pay for the taxonomist to visit the
applicant&rsquo;s laboratory for a period of time, or pay for costs of
computer time or development of interactive keys for electronic
dissemination of systematics results. Requests for support may be in
any amount up to $3,000. We expect to fund between 1-3 of these awards
this year.

=How to apply=Applicants may be from any country, but must be members
of SSB, and are advised to join the Society as soon as possible to
facilitate their applications. A complete application includes:

+ a brief description of the project, including a separate section
justifying the importance of the taxon and the revisionary work
+ an itemized budget (narrative plus budget should not exceed 2 pages)
+ the applicant&rsquo;s CV
+ a letter of support from the taxonomic expert or collaborator
+ If the applicant is a student or post-doc, please also include a
reference letter from the advisor

Grant applications should be sent to the chair of the SSB Awards
Committee (Dr. Tracy Heath: ssb.awards.director@gmail.com). E-mail
submissions are required, and applicants should use pdf format for all
documents. In the subject line of the email, please indicate the SSB
award category as 'Mini-ARTS&rsquo;.

The next application deadline for all materials, including letters of
support and letters of reference, is March 31, 2016.

For information about joining SSB, please see:

  <div class="description">The Geber lab at Cornell University seeks a highly motivated,
detail-oriented assistant for summer 2015 field research in the Southern
Sierra Nevada (May-July) and lab work in Ithaca, NY (July-August).  We are
studying four species of annual plants in the genus Clarkia and their
specialist bee pollinators. Our research focuses on how pollinators may
impact plant species evolution and coexistence.

Our research sites are located in the Kern River Canyon in Kern County,
California. The lab rents a house on a property where other labs working in
this system are also based in the summer. This field assistant would have a
private bedroom, access to a shared bathroom and a communal kitchen, and
wireless Internet access. Frequent trips are made into town (Lake Isabella
and Kernville) for groceries and other supplies.

Successful applicants are expected to assist in data collection, data
entry, and flower, seed, and bee collection in the field; work in Ithaca
will consist of sample processing and data analysis. The assistant will
work a 39-hour workweek. Weather conditions in the Sierras can be very hot
and dry (100+ degrees F) in the summer, so assistants should be prepared to
work in hot conditions. Applicants must be able to hike up and steep hills
for up to 1 mile at a time, stoop or kneel for extended periods of time,
and work in proximity to bees and snakes. The work can be very physically
demanding and tiring, and the research team typically collects data 7 days
a week. A good sense of humor and a positive attitude are essential.
Applicants must be available from the first week of May through late
August, although exact start/end dates are flexible.

Qualifications:
1) Education: some undergraduate education in biology, ecology, or related
field, or equivalent experience
2) Experience: experience with and enthusiasm about working outdoors,
and/or previous field research experience. Previous experience working with
plants, bees, or insects is preferable but not required.
3) Tasks: perform repetitive tasks with attention to detail, daily hiking
4) Personality: interpersonal skills and willingness to live and work in
close quarters with other researchers in a house.

Compensation: transportation to and from California, a private room with
Internet access in the field house, and pay ($13-$15 an hour depending on
experience) will be provided. Applicants will be responsible for securing
their own housing in Ithaca for July and August.

The deadline for applications is March 20, 2016. Applicants should submit:
1) a short (1 page maximum) cover letter describing their qualifications as
well as future academic and professional goals; 2) a resume or CV outlining
previous work experience and relevant courses (completed or in progress),
extracurricular activities; and 3) contact information for two references.

Cornell University is an affirmative action/equal opportunity
employer. Cornell University and we in the Geber lab have a commitment to
support equality of education and employment opportunity by affirming the
value of diversity. We welcome and encourage scientists of all backgrounds
to apply to work with us! <a href="http://bit.ly/21BV9HG">http://bit.ly/21BV9HG</a>

Genomics

We are looking for two enthusiastic students interested in enhancing
their research skills and experience in plant ecology, genomics,
and bioinformatics in the Cruzan lab at Portland State University in
Portland, Oregon.

Successful applicants will become part of a research team working
on dispersal and gene flow in upland prairie plants in Oregon and
Washington under pressure from climate change. Dispersal is critical
for colonization, gene flow, and range expansion, and it is one of
the most important but least understood aspects of the ecology of
plants. Our research utilizes genomic techniques to detect the effects of
dispersal over different spatial scales. This is an integrative research
program that includes field work, wet lab preparation of genomic DNA for
next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics processing of sequence data,
and analysis of patterns of gene flow using GIS and landscape genetic
methods. Students will be exposed to a wide range of methods and are
expected to develop an independent research project within the scope of
the larger research program. More information on our research is posted
on our lab web site: <a href="http://bit.ly/1S9v1xG.">http://bit.ly/1S9v1xG.</a>

Students will be fully supported for 10 to 12 weeks during the summer of
2016. Funding is provided from an REU supplement to our National Science
Foundation Macrosystems Biology grant. Housing will be provided on campus
along with a daily allowance for food and a $500 weekly stipend.

The start of the REU is negotiable with optimal start dates between

A PhD position is available in the Department of Botany and Biodiversity
Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna. The project
will investigate the mechanisms of diversification in bromeliads
(Bromeliaceae; the Ananas / pineapple family), a &lsquo;textbook&rsquo; adaptive
radiation in the tropical plant diversity hotspots of Meso- and South
America. Integrated within an international research consortium, you
will study the ecological & evolutionary genomics of speciation in
tillandsioid bromeliads (Tillandsia and related genera) using 'target
capture&rsquo; resequencing of candidate genes and pathways for key adaptive
traits and neutral reference genome regions. You will analyze these data
jointly with ecological and spatial information, using the latest tools
from population genomics, phylogenomics, and niche modelling. The results
will provide a strong basis for identifying the drivers of speciation in
this highly diverse and ecologically important group of flowering plants,
and potentially in species radiations more generally.

Work place: The Department of Botany and Biodiversity Research houses
several research groups active in ecological & evolutionary genomics,
plant systematics, niche modelling, conservation biology, structural &
functional botany, and plant-animal interactions. Molecular laboratories
and extensive computing resources are available locally and at the Vienna
Scientific Cluster, and second generation sequencing (NGS) facilities are
available in the nearby Vienna Biocenter Core Facilities. The project is
integrated within an international consortium involving three Universities
in Switzerland and several research groups in Mexico and other Meso-
and South American countries. The position is initially for 3 years, with
the possibility of a 4th year extension. University of Vienna offers an
attractive and dynamic research environment, embedded within a city with
exceptionally high quality of life and with numerous outdoor activities
within easy reach.

Start date: Anytime, but ideally before June 2016 for optimal match with
the consortium&rsquo;s field work plans.

Requirements: Experience in the use of molecular genetic markers in
ecology or evolutionary biology; prior experience with / exposure to
the analysis of second generation sequencing data would be beneficial;
good knowledge of English, written and oral; willingness to acquire
basic knowledge of Spanish to facilitate participation in a (moderate)
amount of field work.

  <div class="description">Fully funded PhD studentship in canine genetics: Linking phenotypes with
genotypes for canine chemosensory perception

School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, UK

We are seeking to recruit a Science graduate with MSc or a good BSc
degree (or equivalent) for a project on genetics of canine chemosensory
perception, starting in October 2016. Experience in molecular genetics,
bioinformatics and/or behavioural research methods will be seen as an
advantage. This is a fully-funded position with a stipend of 14,124
per annum for three years for both home and international students. The
project will be supervised by a team of researchers with complementary
expertise in evolutionary genetics (Malgorzata Pilot, primary supervisor),
veterinary behavioural medicine (Daniel Mills) and molecular neurobiology
(Humberto Gutierrez).

This project will address a fundamental question in chemosensory system
evolution concerning the trade-off between olfaction (sense of smell)
and vomeronasal sensing (detection of emotionally salient chemosignals),
and at the same time contribute to improving efficiency of selection of
dogs for detection work (e.g. explosives, drugs). Olfactory receptors
(OR) and vomeronasal receptors (V1R) provide systems to detect
molecules of odorants and chemicals that mediate pheromone perception,
respectively. There is growing evidence on functional and evolutionary
interactions between these two systems, but this has not been assessed yet
at an intra-specific level. The aim of this PhD project is to compare OR
and V1R repertoires and chemosensory perception abilities in different
groups of dogs, including breeds currently used for scent detection
and breeds considered as poor sniffers, and in dogs&rsquo; wild ancestors,
grey wolves. The project will involve the analysis of the complete
set of OR and V1R genes using NGS methods, behavioural experiments to
test odour and pheromone perception performance, and the analysis of
genotype-phenotype interactions.

The student will be supervised by an interdisciplinary team with
complementary expertise in evolutionary genetics and genomics, molecular
neurobiology, neuronal cell signalling, olfaction and pheromone detection,
veterinary behavioural medicine, and behaviour of domestic and wild
canids. Therefore, the student will have an opportunity to obtain a
broad range of research skills, and develop a unique interdisciplinary
research profile. The student will be also given opportunities to attend
external courses and workshops, and international conferences. The School
of Life Sciences provides a great research environment and has a large
international community of postgraduate students.


To apply, send a CV and cover letter to Malgorzata Pilot
(mpilot@lincoln.ac.uk) by 17 April 2016, 11 pm of UK time. You may also
contact Malgorzata Pilot for informal enquiries. Shortlisted applicants
will be invited for interview.

  <div class="description"><p>Three positions open
The Plant and Fungal Trees of Life project (PAFTOL)
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew

1. Senior Researcher (PAFTOL Sampling & Project Co-ordination)
2. Senior Researcher (PAFTOL Phylogenomics)
3. Lead Developer-Bioinformatician (PAFTOL)

Kew is a global resource for plant and fungal knowledge. We are seeking
talented, creative individuals with outstanding track records to help
us build the Plant and Fungal Trees of Life, a major piece of global
science infrastructure that is central to RBG Kew&rsquo;s Science Strategy
2015-2020. This is a unique opportunity to be part of a team addressing
a critical challenge in the life sciences. Are you up to the task? If so,
read on to find out more.

The project:
There are few grander challenges in science than the tree of life
- uncovering the complete evolutionary history linking all life on
Earth. As part of RBG Kew&rsquo;s Science Strategy 2015-2020, we are initiating
a five-year multimillion-pound project, the Plant and Fungal Trees
of Life (or PAFTOL, for short), to complete the tree of life for all
genera of plants and fungi, drawing on our outstanding collections, our
broad collaborative networks and the latest high-throughput sequencing
technologies.  This ambitious project will create a unifying framework
for comparative plant and fungal research and takes us a step closer
to building the tree of life for all known species. We will generate
high impact findings publishable in top science journals, but we want
the results to reach beyond the science community. To achieve this we
will build innovative big-data and visualization tools accessible to
a scientist or a school child. PAFTOL has recently secured generous
funding from the Calleva and Sackler Foundations, and we are now ready
to get the work underway. This is a truly exciting time to join Kew and
become an integral part of a high-profile, cutting edge global endeavour.

The team:
At Kew, you&rsquo;ll be joining a truly multidisciplinary team comprising
experts from across a range of fields including systematics, evolution,
genomics, bioinformatics, spatial analysis, data architecture and
software development. At this time, we are recruiting into three
senior positions in phylogenomics, sampling/co-ordination and software
development/bioinformatics. We expect to hire three further support
positions later this year. You&rsquo;ll work alongside a highly supportive
team of Kew staff who have actively developed the PAFTOL concept.

The roles:
We are currently recruiting into the following three roles:

Senior Researcher (PAFTOL Sampling & Project Co-ordination)

collections are also represented.

Duties: The successful applicant will assist the curator in management
of the collections including specimen sorting, labeling, preparation,
accessioning and databasing new acquisitions; systematic arrangement,
storage and organization of the collection; conservation (ethanol levels,
pH, rehydration, label integrity, rehousing into better containers,
etc.); routine collections tasks (assistance to visitors, response to
requests for information, retrieving, packing and shipping loans to other
institutions, unpacking and curating loan returns and donations to AMNH,
databasing accessions, loan and visitor activity); museum and local
community service (collection tours and related activities); training
and supervision of students and volunteers; management of frozen tissues
and associated data.

Qualifications: BS in Biology, Zoology or Entomology. Candidates
with general knowledge of terrestrial arthropod (preferably
arachnid and/or myriapod) morphology and systematics, good
organizational skills and attention to details, and a good command
of MS Word and Excel are preferred, with more experienced databasing
ability desirable.  For more information and to apply please visit:
