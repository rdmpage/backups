 <title>Contemporary and future studies in plant speciation, morphological/floral evolution and polyploidy</title>
 <link>http://systbio.org.whsites.net/?q=node/434</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://systbio.org/files/roysoc.png" align="right" width="200"/&gt;The Royal Society has published a special issue celebrates the distinguished scientific career of Leslie Gottlieb, who investigated the evolutionary processes that generate the Earth’s life-sustaining plant diversity.&lt;br /&gt;
The articles in this issue discuss results, obtained largely from contemporary genetic-genomic approaches, within the context of Gottlieb’s views on several areas of plant evolution. Collectively, the articles document the importance of Leslie Gottlieb’s contributions to plant evolutionary biology because the same questions, and in some cases the same plants, that interested him are commanding the attention of contemporary workers employing cutting edge techniques today.&lt;br /&gt;
The issue is online at &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/PTB1648"&gt;bit.ly/PTB1648&lt;/a&gt;, you can also buy a print copy at the same link. Quote code &lt;b&gt;TB 1648&lt;/b&gt; for a discount (£35.00 versus usual price of £59.50).&lt;/p&gt;
