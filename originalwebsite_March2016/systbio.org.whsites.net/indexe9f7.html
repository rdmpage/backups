  <div class="description"><p>Behavioural Ecology of seabirds by using bio-logging techniques.

Location: Teuri and Rishiri Islands, Hokkaido, Japan. Duration: 3 months.
Job Type: Volunteer.

We use bio-logging devices (e.g. geolocators, GPS recorders) on two species
(Rhinoceros Auklets and Black-backed Gulls) to study behavioural ecology of
colonial seabirds. Most work will involve assisting a long-term monitoring
project and behavioural studies of post-doc fellows and graduate students
from Hokkaido University coordinated by Yutaka Watanuki, with the daily
monitoring breeding birds and their chicks, and the deployment and
retrieval of tracking devices. It will also involve entering data collected
in the field into databases.

We are looking for an enthusiastic, hardworking young biologist to work as
a voluntary Research Assistant to help with our seabird research on
Teuri/Rishiri Island, Hokkaido, Japan, between May and July 2015. Previous
experience in the field or in harsh conditions is desirable, but not
essential. Work on Teuri/Rishiri requires long hours (with some work at
night and at dawn) spent in a cold and wet environment and considerable
manual work. A successful candidate should be able to work independently
and have a reasonable level of fitness. Planning to embark on further
research degrees in the future would be preferable. It is also important
that the assistant feels comfortable sharing sometimes crowded
accommodation with a number of colleagues over long periods of time, and
can cope with the occasional untidiness inevitably associated with
fieldwork.

Unfortunately we cannot provide a stipend but accommodation (shared and
basic) on Teuri/Rishiri will be covered. However, the project is a great
opportunity to gain valuable experience in modern field ornithology, with
bio-logging techniques. There will also be opportunities for the assistant
to learn some analytical techniques applied to animal movement data.
Teuri/Rishiri has mobile coverage and some access to Internet, however
movements to and from the mainland are limited because of unpredictable
wind conditions. Teuri/Rishiri is an inhabited island and there are small
restaurants and grocery stores. There is a small community of other
researchers, ringers and volunteers at our shared accommodation.

If you are interested, please email a CV and a statement of interest and
arrange for two letters of reference to be emailed to akikosho@gmail.com
 (with ywata@fish.hokudai.ac.jp in cc). The deadline for submitting
applications (including reference letters) is the 31st January 2016. We
will interview the shortlisted candidates (on Skype) shortly after and we
expect to make a decision by late February.

  <div class="description"><p>Three PhD positions study the molecular, chemical and behavioral ecology 
of Sirex woodwasp – University of Pretoria, South Africa

Three PhD positions are available to study the molecular, chemical and 
behavioral ecology of Sirex woodwasp – Amylostereum fungus – Deladenus 
nematode symbioses.  These positions have Forestry and Agricultural 
Biotechnology Institute (FABI), University of Pretoria, South Africa as 
the home institution, but will involve extensive collaborative work with 
the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) and the University of the Sunshine 
Coast in Australia.

The projects
Invasive pests are one of the most significant threats facing plant 
ecosystems and production systems globally; from agriculture to forests 
and forestry. Sirex noctilio and its fungal mutualist, Amylostereum 
areolatum, is a growing model system for understanding processes that 
affect these invasions, as well as the development and implementation of 
management tools for it. One of the primary management tools for this 
invasive pest is biological control using the nematode Deladenus 
siricidicola.

1. How and which visual and olfactory stimuli affect the behavior of 
Sirex noctilio, and how can these be integrated in management programs? 
Potential areas of inquiry may include elucidating kairomone, pheromone, 
visual and genomic stimuli that influence the behavior of S. noctilio. 
The consequences of these stimuli and their potential to contribute 
management tools will be actively explored.
2.  What factors influence the reproductive biology of Sirex noctilio, 
and how does this influence invasive populations? Potential areas of 
inquiry may include elucidating physiological and behavioral traits that 
influence the complex and fascinating reproductive system of this wasp. 
Ultimately the successful candidate will explore molecular tools to 
manipulate outcomes of sexual reproduction.
3.  How do invasion processes and micro-evolution affect symbioses, 
invasive pest adaptation and their biological control agents? The 
project, termed ‘Petri-dish Australasia’ will use the Sirex 
noctilio/Amylostereum areolatum/Deladenus siricidicola as a model system 
to study microevolutionary processes in invasion and biological control 
in Australia and New Zealand.

The projects have the potential to include a combination of field, 
molecular and chemical ecology and genomics. All three projects will 
deal with fundamental questions on the ecology of this intricate, 
tripartite symbiosis, but will either include or contribute directly to 
applied aspects of the management of this global invasive pest complex.
 
Requirements
Candidates should have a Masters or equivalent degree. Candidates are 
not expected to possess advanced skills in all the fields linked to the 
projects, but experience and an interest in at least two of these fields 
will be an advantage. Thus a background in molecular genetics and 
ecology, chemical ecology, behavioral ecology, entomology, microbiology, 
nematology or related fields would be considered an asset.  Resources 
and support to develop these diverse skills in candidates will be 
provided. While the projects will explore novel questions at the 
frontiers of understanding these particular symbioses, as well as 
symbioses and invasive pests in general, they are built on strong 
baseline datasets, extensive resources and support, and a long history 
of excellence and leading work in the field.

Where
Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI), University of 
Pretoria, South Africa. FABI is a global leader in plant biotechnology 
related research, with a strong focus on tree health. The successful 
candidates will join a vibrant, dynamic, highly international (both in 
terms of students, postdocs, staff and networks) and interdisciplinary 
research team, which includes strong research groups in tree health 
research, mycology, entomology, tree and crop genetics, 
plant-microbe-insect interactions, genomics, chemistry and more. The 
laboratories involved have strong links to industry, government and 
international research networks making them a unique and rewarding 
environment to work and launch your research career. For more 
information please visit <a href="http://www.fabinet.up.ac.za/">www.fabinet.up.ac.za</a>.

Remuneration
Full scholarships are offered for all three positions in South Africa 
that will be sufficient to cover accommodation, living costs, 
registration fees, and basic medical aid.  Additional funds will cover 
running costs associated with the project.

When
We are hoping to fill these positions as soon as possible, but no later 
than March 2016. The positions will remain open until a suitable 
candidate has been identified.

Please provide an updated CV, a full academic record and two letters of 
reference, ideally from academic mentors or supervisors that can comment 
on your potential as a future research leader.

campus, UK

On: Trans-generational fitness consequences of chronic stress induced
by global change

Supervisors: Dr Julia Schroeder (Imperial College London) and Prof Terry
Burke (University of Sheffield)

Application deadline: 10 January 2016.

Project description: Human-induced global changes impose chronic
environmental stress on ever more natural populations. The physiological
symptoms of chronic stress are changes in hormone levels that can
lead to stunted growth and increased risk of infection. Furthermore,
the physiological mechanisms invoked by stressed are similar to those
in ageing individuals. Recent studies suggest that chronic stress can
lead to faster senescence (measured in telomere shortening rates), not
only in affected individuals but also in their offspring. What are the
trans-generational fitness consequences of a chronic stress response,
and how is it adaptive? Stress could $B!H(Bprime$B!I(B offspring to enable
them to endure stressful conditions in the future, by a $B!H(Blife-fast
die-young$B!I(B trade-off. This projects tests the hypothesis that chronic
stress primes the next generation. To test this, we make opportunistic
use of an exceptionally well suited long-term $B!H(Bnatural experiment$B!I(B in
wild passerines and supplement statistical analyses on existing long-term
data with focused experiments on captive birds.

The aim of this study is to quantify the fitness consequences of chronic
stress to gain a better understanding of the long-term fitness costs
and benefits of chronic stress in a wild population the consequences for
population viability. The student will utilise a unique long-term study
of a wild passerine population. The precise direction and emphasis of the
project will be determined by collaboration between the student and the
supervisors.  Next to the traditional academic skills, the student will
also learn and improve key skills such as state-of-the-art statistical
modelling, data management, experimental design and field work. The
student can expect to receive exceptional training in state-of-the-art
analytical methodology, as well as benefitting from a well established
and rewarding field project.

Imperial College London is a world leading university; it has been
Ranked 3rd in Europe and 8th in the world by the Time Higher Education
Rankings 2015-16. The student will be based at the Silwood Park campus
 which has a large
graduate student community, with internationally renowned researchers.

The funding for this post is covered by an SSCP DTP-NERC studentship,
and covers home fees and a stipend for 3.5 years. Applicants,
who must be residents of the EU OR have been $B!F(Bordinarily
resident$B!G(B in the UK for 3 years prior to the start of the

  <div class="description"><p>Friday Harbor Laboratories Marine Invertebrate Zoology
June 13 - July 15, 2016

This course will be taught by Dr. Megan Schwartz (University of 
Washington, Tacoma) and Dr. Kevin Kocot (University of Alabama and 
Alabama Museum of Natural History). The course takes advantage of the 
rich marine biota of the Friday Harbor region to teach the principles of 
animal organization and biodiversity. It emphasizes comparative study of 
form and function, and of complexity and diversity in phylogenetic and 
environmental contexts. It focuses on the study of living animals in the 
laboratory and field in the diverse marine habitats surrounding San Juan 
Island.

The course reviews the diversity of animal life in an evolutionary and 
ecological context, focusing on the comparative study of form, function 
and life history. We will review all animal phyla, and also explore 
diversity within phyla based on available exemplars.

Biodiversity is one of the most topical subjects in biology, partly 
because of its accelerating erosion as a result of increasing human 
pressures and global change. Having a working knowledge of the diversity 
of life is fundamental to the study of any subject in biology. FHL is 
arguably the best location in the US for such a course, given the wealth 
of local diversity and accumulated knowledge of the local fauna built 
over a century of investigations.

Applications are welcome from advanced undergraduate students, 
post-baccalaureates, and graduate students. Prior coursework in 
invertebrate biology or animal diversity will be useful; if in doubt, 
please contact one of the instructors.

Enrollment is limited to 20 students. No textbook is required for this 
course.
